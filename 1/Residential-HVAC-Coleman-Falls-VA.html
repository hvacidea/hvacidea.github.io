<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your home that best temperature all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those typical air pollutants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can lead to expensive repairs down the road. So, make certain to alter your AC filters frequently, or get an air conditioning service plan which generally includes a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or live in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>Heavy production markets employ a fairly little percentage of air conditioning service technicians and other HVAC workers, however pay some of the industry's highest salaries. Electrical power generating companies top the list, with an average wage of $34.09 per hour or $70,920 per year. Vehicle parts manufacturers, aerospace makers and automobile makers are all within a few cents of each other at around $31 per hour, or over $64,000 per year. Railways are another high-wage company, at an average of $29.33 per hour or $61,000 each year.<p>
