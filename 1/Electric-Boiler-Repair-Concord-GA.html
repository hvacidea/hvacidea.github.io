Second of all, if you prepare to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, ensure that a reliable moisture barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet. If it ends up being damp, do not permanently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be gotten rid of.<p>
