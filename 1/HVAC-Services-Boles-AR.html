<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have concerns, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase extended guarantees or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
