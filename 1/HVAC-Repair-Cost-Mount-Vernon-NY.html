<p>Sean was really helpful. He is a really enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure used to buy extra things. Responded to all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only factor he could not install the new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in lots. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>A/c can also be provided by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
