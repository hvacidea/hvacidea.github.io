<p>Proper ventilation assists enhance indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are often 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the same pollutants.
