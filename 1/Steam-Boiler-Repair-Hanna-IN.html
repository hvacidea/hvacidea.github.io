<p>Next, and possibly simply as crucial when it concerns central air conditioning expenses, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not have the ability to properly cool the home on hot days. Considering larger systems cost more than smaller sized systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of processes which leads to the supply and elimination of air from inside a structure." Those processes include generating outside air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the structure, and moving some part of indoor air exterior. If several of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
