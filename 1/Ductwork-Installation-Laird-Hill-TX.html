<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended period of constant tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide need to be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements used for computations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most furnaces have multiple control boards. The largest, or just one in some furnaces, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards collaborate the operation and control of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. Do It Yourself repair is possible, but the new control board should be set up precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t appropriately diagnosed, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable as soon as set up. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a pro to identify.<p>
