<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outdoor system as near the house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as vital as a routine oil change in your automobile.

Moreover, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps pollutants and particles in the air. Once every 3 months, Energy Star advises replacing your filter. During high use months, inspect the filters at least month-to-month.<p>
