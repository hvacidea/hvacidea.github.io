<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have concerns, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
