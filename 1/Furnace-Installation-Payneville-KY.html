Cool operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not happy with its appearances in the start. But then understood Air conditioners are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the room temperature, and then switch it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning unit's compressor, wait at least five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
