<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.. Second of all like prolonged car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the required skills to do the job and likewise the morals to treat clients fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be totally taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to correctly service and the system has been running problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
