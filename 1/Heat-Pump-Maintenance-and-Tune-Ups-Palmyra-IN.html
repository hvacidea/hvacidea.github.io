<p>Many commercial buildings utilize mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that become part of the heating and HVAC systems. Some buildings can likewise make use of natural ventilation by opening doors or windows. The ventilation rate" is the amount of outdoor air presented into an area per an unit of time, and is frequently expressed in cubic feet per minute (cfm). You can find the ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, air-conditioning and refrigerating Engineers) minimum ventilation rates for appropriate air quality online.<p>
<p>While these actions will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance items that only a skilled HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, but a house owner doesn't have the tools or abilities needed to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and proper air flow are vital to a well-functioning system, however house owners do not have the essential devices for the job. The bottom line?
