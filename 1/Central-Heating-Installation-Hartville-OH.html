<p>A regular furnace tune up can make the most of performance and supply longer long lasting house heating. However, there are times when a simple maintenance call can identify a concern that will need a substantial financial investment to remedy. Then, it's decision time. Do you make the costly repair and enjoy continued comfort from your present heating unit? Or, do you make an even larger financial dedication to replacing the furnace?
