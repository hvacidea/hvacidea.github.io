<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat rises, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area.

<p>Because Perera funds his acquisitions from the company's cash flow rather than working with a PE company, Air Pros is a little various. He said the selling firms have come from a range of sources, including organisation brokers, financial planners, and owners who became aware of him through word of mouth.
