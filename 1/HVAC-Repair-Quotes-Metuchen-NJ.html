As a society, we make certain that our homes are well-insulated and well-sealed, however we do not believe enough about direct exposure to all the things we position in our homes," states Susan Olesik, PhD, Teacher of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around buildings and structures has a huge effect on your health, and while you can feel the symptoms-- shortness of breath, lightheadedness, queasiness-- right now, they can come on years after direct exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
