<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best thing about G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Makers guarantee would cover the parts cost however G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their service warranty. Likewise they detected the problem and repaired very rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>If the AC does not switch off, it may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils will not give off heat effectively and will keep the unit running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can take place in time since of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must suffice till you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do soon.<p>
<p>As a number of you discussed, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment maker's to ensure your factory guarantees remain in place. Furthermore, the concrete results of a PM is frequently hard to quantify, as one response mentioned the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. A lot of pieces of a furnace or a/c unit do not simply break at the breeze of a finger, however rather is the result of repetitive usage of a part that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, cooking the metal and causing early wear and tear, causing holes and cracks. , if that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and protects the element.. an extremely helpful outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a customer thousands.<p>
