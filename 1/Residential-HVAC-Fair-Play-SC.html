<h3>HVAC Company in Fair Play SC</h3>
<p>All cooling contractors must start their evaluation of your home by carrying out an A/c Contractors of America Manual J load computation. This identifies the heat gain your home is subject to. The estimation is relatively simple to carry out and will reveal what size system you need. If the one you're thinking about wants to determine the best unit for your house solely on experience, move on to another contractor.
