<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't offer them.. Second of all like prolonged car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat customers fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally found someone to appropriately service and the system has actually been running problem free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
