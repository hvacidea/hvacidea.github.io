<p>All houses require reliable ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others.

If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it turns on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even a filthy burner.<p>

<p>Maintenance service was terrific and on time. Josh was quick and very clear about his assessment, ensuring I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>

The lack of moving parts means you're less most likely to invest big on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be expected to last for 50 years. They're significantly more effective then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>
