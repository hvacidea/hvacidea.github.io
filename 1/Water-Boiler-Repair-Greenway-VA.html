<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis.

If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly.<p>
