Normally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, especially if the objective of owning a business was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it took to develop business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't the end objective. HVAC entrepreneur need to strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>
