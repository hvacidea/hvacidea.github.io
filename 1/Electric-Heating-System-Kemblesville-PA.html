<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
