<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. If your a/c unit is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. Simply adding refrigerant is not a service if it leaks. A qualified technician should fix any leak, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the appropriate quantity of refrigerant. Remember that the performance and efficiency of your ac system is greatest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the producer's spec, and is neither undercharged nor overcharged. Refrigerant leakages can likewise be hazardous to the environment.<p>
