<p>The majority of well and city water does not normally consist of lead. Water normally gets lead inside the home from household plumbing that is made with lead products. If there is lead in drinking water is to have it evaluated, the only way to know. Contact the local health department or the water provider to learn how to get the water tested. Send for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, to find out more about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more details.<p>
<p>Typically the most effective way to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate individual sources of contamination or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to reduce the amount of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient technique to securing indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your house are noted later in this section.<p>
<p>After the system has actually been checked for leaks, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers should be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside should be secured with PVC insulation covers.<p>
