<h3>Duct Cleaning in Your Canton MS Home</h3>
<p>Aspects that can add to the development of biological impurities are damp or wet building products (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and poorly kept humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and a/c unit. "Humidifier fever" is a typical disease caused by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Numerous fungi and bacteria grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these impurities can be dispersed into the air and breathed in by the structure occupants. Other possible sources of biological contaminants are family pets and household plants.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<h3>Leaking Ductwork in Canton MS</h3>
