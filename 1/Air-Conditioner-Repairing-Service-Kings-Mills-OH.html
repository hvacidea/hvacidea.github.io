<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Service in Kings Mills</h2>

<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace service technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Air conditioning unit makers normally make rugged, high quality products. Begin by inspecting any fuses or circuit breakers if your air conditioner stops working. Let the unit cool off for about 5 minutes before resetting any breakers. If a central air conditioning conditioner's compressor stops on a hot day, the high-pressure limitation switch may have tripped; reset it by pushing the button, located in the compressor's access panel.<p>
