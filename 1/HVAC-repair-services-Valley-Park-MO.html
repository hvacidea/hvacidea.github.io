Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
