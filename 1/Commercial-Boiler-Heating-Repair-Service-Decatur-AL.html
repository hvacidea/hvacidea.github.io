<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible tube) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- since they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures by means of mechanical and natural ventilation.
