Another repair indication is whether you had to wait to get parts changed. As a furnace ages, it gets more difficult to source replacement parts. Waiting that can be actually cold on a below zero night.<p>
<p>Energy effectiveness can be enhanced even more in central heating systems by presenting zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating systems.
