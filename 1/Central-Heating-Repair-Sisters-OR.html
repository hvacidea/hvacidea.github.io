During the 1970s, many property owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, a lot of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
