<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have problems, they give me priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
