<p>A geothermal heatpump is one of the most energy effective methods of heating or cooling a home. Counting on a series of liquid-filled pipes, a house can be heated in cooler months by condensing and moving energy from the 50- to 60-degree temperatures discovered just a few feet below ground.

Underground temperature remains constant no matter the climate, so geothermal systems provide consistent and dependable heating and cooling.<p>
<p>A specialized air conditioner that is utilized only for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a standard air conditioning system in that both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the same air course. A standard ac system transfers heat energy out of the room because its condenser coil releases heat outside.

Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is really heated, just as by an electric heater that draws the same amount of power.<p>
