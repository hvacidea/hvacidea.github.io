<h3>HVAC Installation in Thousand Oaks California</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the property.<p>
<p>In most cases, if products have failed to dry out a number of days after the believed water occasion, mold development is thought within wall cavities even if it is not right away visible.

In a situation where there shows up mold and the indoor air quality may have been compromised, mold remediation might be needed. Mold testing and examinations must be performed by an independent private investigator to avoid any conflict of interest and to guarantee precise results; complimentary mold testing offered by remediation companies is not recommended.<p>
