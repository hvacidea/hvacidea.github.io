<p>Sean was extremely helpful. He is a really enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure applied to buy extra stuff. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no issues aside from the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>If you see a decline in heat output, first make certain the air filter is tidy and in good condition. Next, inspect other components of the furnace for any accumulation of particles, dirt and dust, an affordable fix that can help boost efficiency. Also, inspect the vents and ducts for blockage. Lastly, ensure the thermostat is working and positioned appropriately. Try moving it far from direct sunlight considering that this might impact temperature level readings on the thermostat and cause it to misread the temperature in your home. Your thermostat will shut off the furnace too early and leave your house feeling cold if this occurs. You may also need to examine your insulation to ensure that warm air does not get away from your area through different openings.<p>
