Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. On the other hand, in big box stores like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in flooring screens. Seattle may be the last city in the nation to deal with the reality of a harsh, vicious summer season.<p>
