Although he didn't have the required replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he could search for and buy it the next morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was absolutely happy to have a heated house once again. What's most amazing was that this all happened during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find someone to assist us right before a holiday, but Environment Pro came through for us. I will happily recommend this company to my friends.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside system as near to your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
