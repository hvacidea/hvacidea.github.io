<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
