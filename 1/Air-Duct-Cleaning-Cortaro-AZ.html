Workplace temperature levels must be preserved in between 68 degrees- 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30%- 60%.

<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ might see undesirable or moldy odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to great structure management.<p>
