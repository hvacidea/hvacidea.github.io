<p>The main issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers try to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system develops more problems, because a few of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the a/c separately for each space. However, now the marketplace has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor systems run separately from each other.<p>

Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no problems aside from the blower motor. The only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
