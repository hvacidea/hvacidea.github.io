<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively the same physical material with time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
