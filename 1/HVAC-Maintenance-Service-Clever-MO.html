Not all heating systems are good for all homes, and there are a couple of aspects that absolutely require to be thought about prior to selecting one. First, you'll require one that is properly sized for your house. A furnace that is too large will put out too much heat for your system to deal with, and will trigger problems like short-cycling that can reduce its life. A furnace that is too little, on the other hand, will not be able to supply adequate heat to keep your house comfortable.<p>
<p>In a location where temperatures reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great primary heating unit. You'll wish to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperatures reach freezing. Your heating technician can set up controls which immediately shut down the heatpump if temperatures drop and reach below freezing. The controls will require the furnace to come on, efficiently heating the house in these conditions.<p>
