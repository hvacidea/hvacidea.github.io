<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned regularly, they can become obstructed with particles that can restrict airflow, possibly affecting your convenience and your system's effectiveness. Filthy filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace elements and in more severe cases cause the system to shut down entirely. By contrast, checking and changing a furnace filter can normally be done in just a few minutes, typically without any tools required. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, normally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
