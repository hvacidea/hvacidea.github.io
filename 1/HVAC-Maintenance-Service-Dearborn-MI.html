<p>HVAC Systems Can Contribute to Air Quality Problems. HVAC systems can also worsen indoor air quality issues.

<p>While people invest 90% of their time inside, indoor air quality has actually not been a large focus of attention for facilities management and renters up until just recently. The coronavirus outbreak is bringing indoor air quality into the spotlight as medical facilities work to alleviate the spread of illness and workplaces, retail, and education centers are considering strategies to resume safely and minimize infection.<p>
<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar made to his employees, equipment costs, marketing, utilities, and other expenditures before paying himself anything. Typically this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, particularly if the objective of owning an organisation was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% is after the few years it required to develop business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't the end goal. HVAC entrepreneur need to pursue 10-15% by cutting costs in some areas or increasing their profits while keeping expenses the same in all other areas.<p>
