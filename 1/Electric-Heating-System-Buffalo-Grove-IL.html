While contaminants typically found in indoor air can cause many hazardous impacts, there is substantial unpredictability about what concentrations or durations of direct exposure are essential to produce particular illness.

<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are termed hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently described as just radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have actually heating components set up in the subfloor of each space in the home, periodically connected to terminal units like baseboard heating systems. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the floor, and into the room. This is why the technique is described as radiant heat.<p>

<p>Second, recognition of impurity sources is frequently crucial to identifying the cause( s) of employee health signs. Such information can often be obtained by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the employer. If keeping an eye on information is not offered, yet a high number of health symptoms have been reported, the Union representative should request that the employer have air tracking tests carried out. Review of this information might determine possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. Nevertheless, when pollutant concentrations are extremely low, monitoring data might not explain the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
