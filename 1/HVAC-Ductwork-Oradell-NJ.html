An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the inbound air is reduced, but it is likewise more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same.
