<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated by radiators are prone to cold spots", implying that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and very hot next to the radiators.

<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product over time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
