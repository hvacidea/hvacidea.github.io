<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost terrific but Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
