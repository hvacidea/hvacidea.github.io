<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they would not provide agreements.  The so called respectable companies rip off more individuals than the fly by night outfits.

<p>Packaged terminal ac system (PTAC) systems are likewise called wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have 2 separate systems (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This lessens the interior system footprint and enables each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adapted to supply heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heatpump While room a/c provides optimum flexibility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is normally more expensive than central air.<p>
