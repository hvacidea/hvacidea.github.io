<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Proper ventilation assists enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and in some cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the very same pollutants. In other words, in some cases the air inside can be more harmful than the air exterior.<p>
<p>For example, impurities may collect within the air diffusers and grills, introducing pollutants into the environment. Or if the outside air consumption is located near a source of wetness or other outside pollutant, it may act as a pathway to bring the contaminants inside.

This is much more cost-effective on a smaller sized scale. Bigger remodellings like additions to a home might be suitable for a larger scale and more costly hydronic system.<p>
