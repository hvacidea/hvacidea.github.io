<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall. A ductless unit has a built-in efficiency benefit since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system might be lost to leaks in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are great for additions since they don't require any brand-new ductwork to be set up. Because an unit is set up in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensing units that instantly raise the temperature level in the room when you exist.<p>
