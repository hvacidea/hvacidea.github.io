<p>I typically do not leave reviews however wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to change your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
