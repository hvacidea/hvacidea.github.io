<p>4 Seasons has set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have actually found them to be reasonably priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was necessary and renovated the whole plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater since the technicians believed they just didn't seem right and they could not leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
