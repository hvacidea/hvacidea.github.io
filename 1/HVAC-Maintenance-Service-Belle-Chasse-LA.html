<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness. The objective is to supply adequate changes to make sure a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this.

The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
