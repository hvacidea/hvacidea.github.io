Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
