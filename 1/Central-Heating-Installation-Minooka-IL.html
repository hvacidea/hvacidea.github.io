Air conditioners assist to dehumidify the incoming air, however in exceptionally damp environments or in cases where the air conditioning system is oversized, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy usage, both for the dehumidifier itself and since the air conditioner will require more energy to cool your house. A more suitable alternative is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to many existing systems.<p>

<h3>HVAC repair services in Minooka IL</h3>
<p>Central air units are determined in loads. This measurement is based upon the system's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it suggests the quantity of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>They were terrific! Numerous HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally asked for. They met my needs completely by providing a professional quote with choices, without pushing additional items. The crew appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The also immediately followed up with the required evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I extremely suggest this company.<p>
<p>The main reason property owners do not buy an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost in between $150 and $500 per year, depending upon the amount of services offered. If the system is new and still under a producer's guarantee, the cost might not be beneficial. Any major repairs should be covered under the maker's guarantee. However, some producers need routine maintenance as a term of the guarantee.<p>
