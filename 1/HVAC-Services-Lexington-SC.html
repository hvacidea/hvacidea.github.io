<p>Great Product! Delivery was sort of unusual being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The product was extremely lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to enjoy the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets.

Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are usually just offered for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity.
