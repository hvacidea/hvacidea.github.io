<p>All homes need reliable ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it might be that your pilot light has been burnt out from use.

When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your home.
