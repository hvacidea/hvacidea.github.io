<p>It prevails to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical product with time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions.

Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
