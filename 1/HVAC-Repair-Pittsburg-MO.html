<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these three things initially. Make sure all the signs up in your home are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the minimized airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's great airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've fixed the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

However more intricate problems-- recognized by regularly inappropriate air quality tracking results-- will require a various tack. Depending on the problem you're experiencing, one of the 3 techniques listed below might be proper.<p>
