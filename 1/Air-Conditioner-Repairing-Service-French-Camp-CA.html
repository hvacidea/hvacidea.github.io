<p>Ask about training and accreditations. An excellent place to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) certification. It's sort of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, however a lot of contractors out there have not bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by searching for Structure Efficiency Institute (BPI) accreditation. Supervisors with BPI certification understand that the house is a system and see HVAC equipment as just one element (out of many) of a comfy environment.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are extremely complicated and structure occupants may be exposed to a range of impurities (in the type of particles and gases) from workplace makers, cleaning products, construction furnishings, carpets and activities, perfumes, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure products, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outdoor contaminants. Other factors such as indoor temperature levels, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also affect how people respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you may select to replace the outdoor compressor with a modern, high-efficiency unit. If you do so, consult a local heating and cooling contractor to ensure that the brand-new compressor is appropriately matched to the indoor unit. However, considering recent modifications in refrigerants and cooling designs, it may be smarter to replace the whole system.<p>
