<p>Called WSE for a regular assessment. The tech appeared right on time and was educated & friendly throughout the visit. They suggested replacing a couple of parts that were going out. They weren't low-cost but a quick internet search validated WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the visit or the brand-new part. I was really delighted they waited their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them again.<p>
<p>When setting up the entire system, geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types. Geothermal systems require underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy.
