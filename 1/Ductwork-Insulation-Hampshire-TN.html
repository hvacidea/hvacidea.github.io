<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have issues, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I don't require.<p>
