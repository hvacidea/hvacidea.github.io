<p>Reality: Federal and local incentives typically amount to between 30 and 60 percent of total geothermal system cost, which can typically make the preliminary cost of a system competitive with standard devices. Standard air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, during new construction (homes usually utilize between one and five tons). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per ton, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per lot. Nevertheless, new installation practices are decreasing expenses, to the point where the rate is getting closer to standard systems under the ideal conditions.<p>
