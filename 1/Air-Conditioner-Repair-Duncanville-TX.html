<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do decline them until they have been properly dried. If items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
