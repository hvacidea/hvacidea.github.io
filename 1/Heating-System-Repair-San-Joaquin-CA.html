<h3>Electric Heating Systems in San Joaquin California</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible growth or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and keep. Leaky return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you believe a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
