<h3>Boiler Heating System in Beecher IL</h3>
<p>I have actually been using them for years for my organisations, my own homes and my realty customers' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the issues which didn't cost me as much. Another occasion when the AC quit working at my rental home. When I called and he recommended me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again, he helped me trouble shoot the issue. He is sincere, dependable, and reasonable on rate. It's difficult to find a truthful AC man and I'm pleased I found Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
