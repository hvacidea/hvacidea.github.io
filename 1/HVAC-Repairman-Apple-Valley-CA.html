For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed regularly than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. Additionally, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
