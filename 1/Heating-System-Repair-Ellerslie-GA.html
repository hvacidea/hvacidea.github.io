<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is caused by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the production of an aerosol impact, many typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from inadequately put or kept evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which may enter close-by ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical centers and retirement home, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor water fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to acquire infection.<p>
