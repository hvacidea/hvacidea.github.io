<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Illness is caused by a waterborne germs Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the production of an aerosol impact, many typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial buildings is from inadequately put or kept evaporative cooling towers, which frequently launch water in an aerosol which may enter close-by ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical centers and retirement home, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis.

The existence of Legionella in commercial building water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to acquire infection.<p>
