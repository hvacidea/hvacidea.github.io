Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no concerns other than the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
