<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outside unit as near your home as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

An air toxin might likewise come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a defective furnace, volatile natural compounds (VOCs) from a newly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or individual care items. Viruses and bacteria, animal dander, and insect parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
