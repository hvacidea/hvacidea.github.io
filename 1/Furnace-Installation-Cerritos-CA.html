AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of typical a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to change it every 5 years or two.

<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace at Cerritos CA?</h3>
<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can cause watery eyes, burning sensations in the eyes and throat, queasiness, and difficulty in breathing in some humans exposed at elevated levels (above 0.1 parts per million). High concentrations may trigger attacks in individuals with asthma. There is proof that some individuals can develop a level of sensitivity to formaldehyde.

<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
