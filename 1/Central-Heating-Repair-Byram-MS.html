<p>Occupational exposure limits utilize dose-response information which reveal the health results of repetitive exposure to one specific chemical.

<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as created. Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to save energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperatures (style levels), instead of the greater temperature levels often used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to supply thermal comfort indoors. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors develops the requirement for cautious attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities trigger mold growth and wetness inside your home is connected with a greater frequency of occupant respiratory problems.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Decreasing pollutant concentration by utilizing cleaner (outdoor) air to dilute contaminated (indoor) air. Local building regulations likely define the amount (and often quality) of outside air that should be continually supplied in your structures, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Temporarily increasing ventilation paired with correct usage of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for example, can be beneficial in diluting the concentration of harmful fumes in the air.<p>
