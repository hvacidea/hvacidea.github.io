<p>Exposure Control: Changing the time and area of contaminant direct exposure. An example of time control is arranging flooring removing and waxing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday.

Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
<p>The majority of HVAC systems now have programmable thermostats that allow property owners to manage the temperature level and set it on a schedule.
