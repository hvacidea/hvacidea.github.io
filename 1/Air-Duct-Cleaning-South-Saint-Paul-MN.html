<p>Trace was the service technician that looked after my semi yearly maintenance today. Trace was on time, considerate, and respected my house by always wearing boot coverings when entering my house. He demonstrated the points of evaluation and likewise advised I have a UV light installed due to a little accumulation of mold building up in the air handler, which he thoroughly checked and cleaned up the outside compressor coils in addition to ensured the wetness discharge tube was clear by using a cleaning liquid and a shop vacuum. He likewise eliminated the leaves that accumulated inside the interior of the compressor system and advised an option to prevent it from continuing, which will do.I received a detailed email report of the examination laying out all the electronic measurements and service.Trace is a property to Waychoff's and I highly advise him and Waychoff's for service and installation.<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his evaluation, guaranteeing I understood what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
