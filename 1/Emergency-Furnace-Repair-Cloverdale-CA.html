<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to look out for. First, you should inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
