<p>AC systems and thermostats have integrated delay features when they're shut down and after that repowered. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>When installing over concrete slabs, we recommend using our insulation boards. When utilized in combination with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely efficient thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you cash. They reflects the heat upwards into the flooring tile rather of allowing heat to heat up the concrete piece below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will warm up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
