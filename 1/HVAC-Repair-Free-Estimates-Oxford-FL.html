<p>A main factor in the avoidance of health signs is an effective, properly created and operating ventilation system. The ventilation system determines the quality of the indoor air by controlling the amount of air that is added to the work environment atmosphere, the cleanliness of such outside air, and the rate at which the workplace air and its pollutants are either tired to the re-circulated or outdoors throughout the structure.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high efficiencies, and are often combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be utilized for summertime cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>

<p>You're motivating the growth of mold in wet air if you set it too low. The heat dries the air, avoiding mold development and contamination. Naturally, too-dry air can also aggravate your lungs and sinuses, while too much indoor humidity can contribute to the growth of germs and infections, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Health and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a house is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
<p>This is especially notable, as gas stoves can trigger levels of pollution that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with improperly adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's guidelines.<p>
