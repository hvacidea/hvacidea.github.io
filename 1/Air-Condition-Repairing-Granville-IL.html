<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace service technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC refrigerators unlawful. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the approach as "that German innovation". 29 31 Nonetheless, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to produce a business coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, four years later on, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take actions to support production and use in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA decided in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-134a, r-404a and r-410a are, as of 2020, being changed with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and a/c, R-1234yf in vehicles, R-32 in residential a/c and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration.
