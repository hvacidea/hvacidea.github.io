<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it needs to run longer than a correctly sized system. Because it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger unit, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity effectively. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a chance to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the required moisture. The result is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature level indicates. In fact, the room can feel damp and clammy.<p>
