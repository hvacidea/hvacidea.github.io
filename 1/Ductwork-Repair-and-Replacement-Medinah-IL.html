<p>. Prior to choosing the installation area of a/c unit, several main aspects require to be considered. Firstly, the direction of air circulation from the indoor systems ought to not fall on the place of rest or workspace. Second of all, there need to not be any obstacles en route of the air flow that might avoid it from covering the space of the premises as much as possible.
