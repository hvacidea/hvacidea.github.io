<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outdoor unit as near to your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Reality: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are extremely unusual now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>Our indoor air quality experts can transform your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center. To lower contaminants, we advise setting up advanced air cleaning systems like MicroPower Guard filters, which are developed to eliminate the smallest particles from the air. The OxyQuantum UV sanitation systems likewise help manage germs and organic odors. Most store-bought filters can not remove these smallest of irritants and do not get rid of gases and bacteria.<p>
<p>A customized a/c unit that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also uses a refrigeration cycle, however differs from a basic air conditioning unit in that both the condenser and the evaporator are put in the very same air path. Because its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the room. Nevertheless, considering that all elements of the dehumidifier are in the very same room, no heat is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the space is really heated, simply as by an electric heating system that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
