<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently gets requests for assessment and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. The probability of immediate responses to indoor air toxins depends upon a number of aspects including age and preexisting medical conditions. In some cases, whether a person responds to a pollutant depends upon specific level of sensitivity, which differs tremendously from person to individual. Some people can become sensitized to chemical or biological contaminants after repeated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area. All objects in the hot zone reach stability in temperature level after the radiant heat system has actually been running for a while, including people. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off.<p>
