<p>How climate modification impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for modern-day a/c unit) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system increase. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c unit removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
