Not only was the cost fantastic but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
