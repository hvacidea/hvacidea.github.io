<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a reference later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports ought to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Eliminate the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>

What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
