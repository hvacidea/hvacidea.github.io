<p>Specific instant effects resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often difficult to figure out if the symptoms are an outcome of direct exposure to indoor air pollution. For this reason, it is necessary to pay attention to the time and location the symptoms take place. If the signs fade or go away when a person is away from the house and return when the individual returns, an effort ought to be made to identify indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some effects may be intensified by an insufficient supply of outside air or from the heating, cooling, or humidity conditions prevalent in the home.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it might flatter twice the electricity that even a low-end new one would use. That's because it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to offer a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment installed just a few years ago.<p>
