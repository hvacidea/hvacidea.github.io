<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
