<p>I am changing our High Speed System because of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Convenience Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also installing an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high speed supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have a choice for an additional $2,818.00 to set up a Provider Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the same. As soon as the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats. Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately treat and solidify-- typically 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the concept of an in-floor heating unit seems less like a luxury product and more like a need. (Besides, heated floors were excellent enough for the Roman Empire) But prior to you devote to what can be a significant renovation project, it's finest to ask yourself whether a glowing floor heater is a proper service for your particular house heating needs.<p>
