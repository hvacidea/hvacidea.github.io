<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between a outdoor and indoor unit instead of ducting air directly from the outdoor system.

Other indoor units install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have actually found them to be fairly priced, prompt and do great work.

<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
