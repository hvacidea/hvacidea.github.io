<h3>Electric Heat Pump in Montrose CA</h3>
<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heating system, managing the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature level of the floor. All electrical wiring for your radiant heating system either goes to it or from it. Many people will install their thermostat near the entryway of the space they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is fine as long as the location is dry and unobstructed.<p>

It's sort of a minimum requirement for selecting an HVAC company, but a great deal of contractors out there have not troubled with it!
