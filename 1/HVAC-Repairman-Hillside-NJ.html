<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have issues, they provide me priority and a lower rate. Purchased a new primary system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy prolonged guarantees or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
