However, select your contractor sensibly, much of the 'trusted' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to improper sales tactics that DO take advantage of uninformed property owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a good base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a respectable company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>

See the chart below for the typical central air conditioner replacement costs by LOADS.<p>
