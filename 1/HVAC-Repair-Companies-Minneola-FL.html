<p>MacDonald-Miller's focus is on preventative maintenance by using wise innovation. Martin said the company can establish a dashboard within the building's controls that will supply data on its systems to enable actual time exposure, providing the capability to be preventative rather than reactionary. This service can be supplied to any commercial customer, not just throughout new construction.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things initially. Make sure all the signs up in the house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed, the decreased air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the issue.<p>
