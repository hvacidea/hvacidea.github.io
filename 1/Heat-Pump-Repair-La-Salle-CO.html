<h3>Get Your HVAC System Serviced Annually in La Salle CO</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his evaluation, guaranteeing I understood what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a reference later on). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Remove the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>
