<h3>Air Conditioner Repairs Near me in Centerton Arkansas</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs silently and effectively, but to have 2 significant components stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>When installing the entire system, geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types. Geothermal systems need underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy. Setting up one included excavation, running hundreds of backyards of piping, burying the loop, and more. This process is quite costly. Setting up a new geothermal heatpump to deal with an existing ground loop is far less expensive.<p>
