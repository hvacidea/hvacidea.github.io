<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise given that 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one constraint: their total power ought to not go beyond the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, nevertheless, it is extremely common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units higher than the outdoor capability by at least 20%.

<p>For instance, issues arise when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to generate sufficient quantities of outdoor air. Insufficient ventilation likewise occurs if the air supply and return vents within each space are blocked or placed in such a method that outdoor air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of building occupants. Incorrectly situated outdoor air intake vents can also generate air infected with car and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from washrooms.
