<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide car debit lots of companies do so they can have a known quantity of cash being available in monthly, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to provide car debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There must not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this assists.<p>

<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality at Pleasant Valley VA</h3>
<p>Many Canadian jurisdictions do not have particular legislation that handles indoor air quality problems. In the lack of such legislation, the "basic responsibility clause" uses. This provision, typical to all Canadian occupational health and safety legislation, mentions that a company should offer a healthy and safe office. Hence, making sure the air is of excellent quality is the employer's duty.<p>
<p>Open windows or utilize exhaust fans. Ventilation, a common method of minimizing exposure to indoor air contaminants, also will lower but not eliminate exposure to ecological tobacco smoke. Due to the fact that cigarette smoking produces such large amounts of contaminants, mechanical or natural ventilation methods do not eliminate them from the air in your home as rapidly as they develop. In addition, the big increases in ventilation it requires to significantly decrease direct exposure to ecological tobacco smoke can also increase energy expenses significantly. As a result, the most effective method to minimize direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the house is to get rid of smoking cigarettes there.<p>
