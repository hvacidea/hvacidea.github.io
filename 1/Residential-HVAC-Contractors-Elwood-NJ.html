This is generally utilized in a 2nd or third-floor  location and takes advantage of the floor joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional thickness of an in-screed concrete put. To make an under-timber glowing floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipes to direct heat upward.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
