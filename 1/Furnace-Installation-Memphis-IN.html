<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Companies in Memphis</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer. These convection heating systems are still extensively used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too quickly, and your home will not heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter also causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<p>The predominant health impact connected with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your threat of lung cancer is specifically high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
