<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of steady tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 should be calibrated often, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
