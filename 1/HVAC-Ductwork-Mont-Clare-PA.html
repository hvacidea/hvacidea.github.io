<h3>Powerful Methods for Furnace Cleaning in Mont Clare PA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, conducted a research study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by enhancing airflow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In many cases, determined particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Using a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors significantly reduces direct exposure to contaminants during cooking. Inappropriate modification, typically shown by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame tip is blue.

Always ensure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace remains in use.<p>
