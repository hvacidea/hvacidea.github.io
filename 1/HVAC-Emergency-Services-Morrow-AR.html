<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the primary problem. While setting up a separate split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system creates more difficulties, since some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the cooling separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
<h3>AC Maintenance Cost in Morrow Arkansas</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the see. They suggested changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't inexpensive but a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day. He knew simply what the problem was and fixed it very quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
