<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as an Essential Organisation in Los Angeles. Changed to utilizing Wachoff's about a year back and they've been to your house for a system tune-up three times now. They're priced fairly, have managed the one repair I needed well, and are professional and constantly on-time. Have been through a few companies throughout the years and Wachoff's is certainly the best I have actually had the chance to deal with and Jesse, my technician 2 of 3 of those times, has been great.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate fantastic but Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating unit require reasonably little attention. However, similar to any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is necessary to keep the system working smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater resemble those of traditional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and tank should be checked for leakages, the system needs to be flushed regularly to remove tank and gathered pollutants (scaling in difficult water areas). The systems must be examined at least twice each year for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be washed regularly to get rid of dust collected in order to enhance collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
