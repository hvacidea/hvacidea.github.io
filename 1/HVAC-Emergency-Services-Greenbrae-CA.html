<p>I am an investor, I require to replace two furnaces in a 8000square foot home. Some sources, such as building products, home furnishings and items like air fresheners, can release contaminants more or less continuously.

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material in time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
