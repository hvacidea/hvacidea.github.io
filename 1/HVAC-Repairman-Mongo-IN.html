<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts.
