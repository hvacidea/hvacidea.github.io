<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to switch 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years approximately. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to getting rid of the wires. Then move the wires to the brand-new system (Picture 6).<p>
<h3>Passive Ventilation in Sumner Washington</h3>
<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either since of visible growth or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much excellent if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and preserve. Dripping return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
<p>Energy performance can be enhanced much more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This permits a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heater. Zones are controlled by several thermostats. In water heating unit the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they manage zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the circulation of air. In this case, the control system is really vital to keeping a proper temperature.<p>
