<p>Our indoor air quality experts can convert your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center. To reduce contaminants, we recommend installing sophisticated air cleaning systems like MicroPower Guard filters, which are designed to eliminate the tiniest particles from the air. The OxyQuantum UV sterilization systems likewise help manage germs and natural smells. A lot of store-bought filters can not eliminate these tiniest of irritants and do not remove gases and bacteria.<p>
<p>Air conditioning unit can create a lot of water due to the fact that they get rid of wetness from the air. To get rid of this, they have a typically plastic drain pipeline that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location. To deal with condensate problems, please see A/c Leaks Water, below.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
