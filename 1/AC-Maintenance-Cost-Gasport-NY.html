<p>All heating systems have some level of air filtration. From one of the most fundamental, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter often in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all require some standard maintenance. These filters aid with indoor air quality by trapping airborne pollutants flowing through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping in reducing the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from collecting on internal components like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>

<p>People operating in buildings with bad IAQ may discover undesirable or moldy smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more severe problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to great structure management.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor impacting indoor air quality, but it is often utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there are in a space or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too expensive-- which can have an unfavorable effect on occupants-- outdoors air must be deliberately brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
