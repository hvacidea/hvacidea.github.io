<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Most furnaces have several control boards. The largest, or just one in some heating systems, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, however the brand-new control panel should be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t properly identified, changing a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable once set up. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a professional to diagnose.<p>
