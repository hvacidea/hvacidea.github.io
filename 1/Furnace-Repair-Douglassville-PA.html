<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our new furnace and AC system. The very best aspect of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a number of months (no fault of G&S). Producers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their guarantee. Also they detected the problem and fixed really quickly. Certainly A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the same. When the electrical wiring is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively cure and solidify-- generally 2 to four weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
<p>When it comes to heated water or steam, piping is used to carry the heat to the rooms. Most modern-day hot water boiler heating unit have a circulator, which is a pump, to move hot water through the distribution system (instead of older gravity-fed systems ). The heat can be transferred to the surrounding air utilizing radiators, hot water coils (hydro-air), or other heat exchangers. The radiators might be mounted on walls or installed within the flooring to produce flooring heat.<p>
