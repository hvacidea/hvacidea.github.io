<p>In houses, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pressed wood products made using adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pressed wood products made for indoor use include: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in kitchen cabinetry and furnishings); wood plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops). Medium density fiber board includes a greater resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood product and is typically acknowledged as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood product.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the eye, throat, and nose and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal studies that duplicated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular risk from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in structures with bad IAQ might observe moldy or unpleasant smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse, talk with your doctor about them. But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to good building management.<p>
<p>Examples of non-friable asbestos products consist of vinyl asbestos flooring tiles, acoustic ceiling tiles, and asbestos cement items. These items present a risk just when they are handled in a way that creates dust consisting of asbestos fibers which can be inhaled.

This can result in the potential for significant illness.<p>
