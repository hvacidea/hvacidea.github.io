<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, work environments and homes matters, especially because we spend the majority of our lives inside. Air conditioning system help to dehumidify the inbound air, but in incredibly humid environments or in cases where the air conditioner is large, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioner will require more energy to cool your home. A more effective option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be added as a retrofit to a lot of existing systems.<p>
<p>If you seem like the air produced by your heat pump is burning out cold, you may not have an issue as long as your house still warms to the right temperature level.

However, if your system does not appear to be working correctly, check outside to see if your unit is frozen or covered in ice. This would be an instance where you must employ a specialist to repair the system and examine.<p>
