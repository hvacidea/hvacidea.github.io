<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not provide off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can occur in time because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work till you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
