<p>Award Winning Pipes and HVAC Services. Many typical building materials utilized prior to 1975 contain asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials.

Removal of asbestos-containing materials is not constantly ideal because the fibers can be spread into the air throughout the removal procedure. A management program for intact asbestos-containing materials is typically recommended instead.<p>
<p>The life expectancy of a central air system is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning unit are more energy effective than models made 5 years ago, so it makes monetary sense to change or upgrade your unit if it's five years old or older.
