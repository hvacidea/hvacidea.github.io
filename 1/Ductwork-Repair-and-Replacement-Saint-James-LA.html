Scott was really educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the auto debit, although my company does not use automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of cash being available in each month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to offer auto debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement..
