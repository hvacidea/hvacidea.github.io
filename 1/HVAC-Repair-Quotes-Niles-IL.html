<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in loads. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 heap system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it means the amount of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>We look at clues prior to we offer suggestions to change instead of repair a heater. Among the ideas we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to usage, or if energy costs are higher year after year, we know the system is not running effectively. It may be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more effective design, then you would be losing money by not changing the older unit.<p>

Because these warranties lead the HVAC industry in covering parts and crucial mechanical parts, you can rest assured knowing you've picked the best furnace and air conditioning system for your home or service.<p>
