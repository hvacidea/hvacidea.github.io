The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine components.
