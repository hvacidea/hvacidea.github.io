<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize unit will not be able to cool rooms down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. Since it merely takes more electrical energy to run a larger system, a large-scale compressor also costs more to operate. And a large-scale unit does not lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a chance to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the required wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature suggests. In fact, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>
