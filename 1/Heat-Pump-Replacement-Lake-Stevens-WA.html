<p>In a typical residential HVAC company, the owner pays the majority of every dollar earned to his staff members, devices expenses, marketing, utilities, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not sound like much, especially if the objective of owning an organisation was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the few years it took to construct business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't the end goal. HVAC business owners should strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the exact same in all other areas.<p>
