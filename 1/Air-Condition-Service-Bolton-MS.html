<h3>Heat Pump Cost in Bolton Mississippi</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<p>After residing in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the a/c. I went ahead and bought this Carrier and I should state it does the job rather well.

The unit hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>

<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 guideline however got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside your home and never ever requires maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
