<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up frequently, they can become clogged with debris that can restrict airflow, potentially affecting your convenience and your system's efficiency. Filthy filters can trigger extra wear and tear on furnace elements and in more severe cases trigger the system to shut down completely. By comparison, examining and changing a furnace filter can typically be carried out in just a couple of minutes, often with no tools required. As a precaution, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
