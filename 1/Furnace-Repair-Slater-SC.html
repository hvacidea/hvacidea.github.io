<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds incredible, however furnace technicians often discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear out and are at the top of the list of common air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years approximately.

<p>Furthermore, clean and even vacuum repeatedly in the location where your heater is located.
