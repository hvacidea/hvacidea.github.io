What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my options. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over options. I arranged my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me regarding an uncommonly high expense that I got blindsided by PRIOR TO he understood that I had actually called the service manager and left a message of concern. Ron had actually found the difficulty location in examining the costs. He resolved the problem in one day, had actually adjusted the costs to what I thought about fair before he recalled, understood what might have caused the issue and had a strategy to insure that it would not take place once again. I have considered All Points a company with integrity for the nine years we have used them. This experience validates that.<p>
