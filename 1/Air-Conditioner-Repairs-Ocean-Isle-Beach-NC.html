<h3>Things to Know Before Becoming a HVAC Contractor at Ocean Isle Beach NC</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  unit instead of ducting air directly from the outside unit. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is normally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
