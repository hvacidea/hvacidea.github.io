<p>There are lots of sources of indoor air pollution in any home. These consist of combustion sources such as oil, gas, kerosene, wood, coal, and tobacco products; structure materials and furnishings as diverse as scrubby, asbestos-containing insulation, wet or damp carpet, and kitchen cabinetry or furnishings made of certain pressed wood items; items for household cleaning and maintenance, personal care, or hobbies; central heating and cooling systems and humidification devices; and outside sources such as radon, pesticides, and outdoor air pollution.<p>

<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to change your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as important as a routine oil modification in your car.

Throughout high use months, inspect the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
