Other radiators are still used, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating systems-- although ceiling radiators are almost always used in commercial applications like warehouses.<p>

<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of strong particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by building, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into structures by means of natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
