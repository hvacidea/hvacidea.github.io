<p>Geothermal heating is one of the most efficient heating sources in regards to environmental costs. Since the energy utilized to heat your home is extracted straight from the ground, it secures the environment from hazardous digging, fracking, or contaminants.

While geothermal systems do utilize some electricity, they launch far fewer greenhouse gases or other toxins than heating unit that need natural gas, oil, or electric heat.<p>
<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System due to the fact that of a severe refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted devices, a Carrier, Convenience Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise installing an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding 3 (3) high speed supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have an option for an extra $2,818.00 to set up a Carrier Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, but many utilize the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is probably a much better solution. If the current system has not incurred other significant repairs, is in otherwise excellent condition, and concerns that caused the breakdown can be recognized and treated, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense too.<p>
