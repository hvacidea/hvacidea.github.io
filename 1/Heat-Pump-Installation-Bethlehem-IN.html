Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the disconnect block (Image 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Photo 2).

<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
