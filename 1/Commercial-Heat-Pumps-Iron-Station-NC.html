<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outside  system instead of ducting air directly from the outside unit. Indoor units with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>When all the jobs have actually been completed, the last task is to check the system to ensure it cools successfully. HVAC systems are run through the thermostat. This final check may mention faults in the thermostat, which may be as basic as a need to change batteries. A failure to switch on might simply involve a tripped breaker. At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician goes over any problems or issues and makes suggestions about upgrades where suitable.<p>
