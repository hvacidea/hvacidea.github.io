<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up procedures.
