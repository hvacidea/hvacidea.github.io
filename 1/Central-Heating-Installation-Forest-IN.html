You can often conclude that the capacitor has failed. Sometimes you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. However the chances are good that this may work for one cycle, but the capacitor will stop working next time the AC goes on. It's finest to replace the capacitor.<p>
<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control might contravene efforts to try to enhance the operation to save energy.

Nevertheless, for the majority of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to offer thermal convenience indoors.
