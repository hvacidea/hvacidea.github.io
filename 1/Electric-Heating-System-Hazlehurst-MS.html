<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the typical house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the incoming air is minimized, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather considerable.<p>
