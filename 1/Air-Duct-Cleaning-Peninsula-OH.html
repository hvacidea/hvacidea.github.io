<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average house. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is minimized. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
