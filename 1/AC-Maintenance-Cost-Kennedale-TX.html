<p>Correct ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the very same toxins. To put it simply, often the air inside can be more hazardous than the air outside.<p>

<p>Factors that can add to the growth of biological pollutants are moist or damp building materials (carpets, ceilings, walls) and improperly kept humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioning unit. "Humidifier fever" is a typical illness triggered by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs.
