Contaminants might originate from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in a connected garage, backyard trash burning, or radon entering your home from the ground below. An air pollutant could also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a defective furnace, unstable natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted space, secondhand smoke, mold growing on moist or wet carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or individual care products.

<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious element impacting indoor air quality, however it is frequently used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level.

To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too expensive-- which can have an unfavorable influence on occupants-- outdoors air must be intentionally brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
