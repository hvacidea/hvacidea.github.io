<p>Appropriate ventilation assists improve indoor air quality. It's simple to think that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside.

According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and sometimes these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same toxins.

<p>Radiant heating provides a number of special advantages over forced air heating systems. For example, radiant heat systems are more energy effective than forced air systems.

<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have issues, they provide me concern and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
