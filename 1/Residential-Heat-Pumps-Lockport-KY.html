<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power should not surpass the capability of the outside unit.

Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace kicks in and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off.<p>
