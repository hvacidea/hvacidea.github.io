<p>Martin said the company is ready to put down roots" in the Tri-Cities and expects to have a group of about 7 to 10 staff members when it opens the doors on the brand-new center by early fall.

<p>Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems by including new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit contaminants.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Consider potential impacts of indoor air pollution if you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit. Follow the manufacturer's directions, especially directions on the correct fuel and keeping the heating system appropriately changed. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is usually an indicator of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions. While a space heater is in use, open a door from the room where the heating unit lies to the remainder of the home and open a window somewhat.<p>
