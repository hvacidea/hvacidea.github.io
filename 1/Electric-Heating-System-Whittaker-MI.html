<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in tons. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't knowledgeable about the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>

Due to the fact that it has actually restored my faith in great manufacturing, am thankful I got this though. I havenâ $ t had a problem with this new Carrier I got because I purchased it 7 months back. Itâ $ s just perfect.<p>
