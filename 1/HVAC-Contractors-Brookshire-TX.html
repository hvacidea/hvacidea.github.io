<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the very same.

Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately cure and solidify-- usually 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom flooring.<p>
