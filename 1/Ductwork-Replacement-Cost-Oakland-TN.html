<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace professionals typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were popular in the first half of the 20th century, especially in commercial buildings, apartment buildings and very large homes. Lots of steam and radiator boiler systems installed more than 50 years ago stay operable, due to the fact that the absence of moving parts makes them less vulnerable to use and tear. A steam boiler replacement expenses in between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>
