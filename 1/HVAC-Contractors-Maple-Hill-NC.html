<p>My eldest boy constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For some time I dismissed him however then I understood that it truly didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think of anything else except replacing it. The one I got deserves every penny.

<p>The predominant health result associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your threat of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
