<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer car debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of money being available in on a monthly basis, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to provide vehicle debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
