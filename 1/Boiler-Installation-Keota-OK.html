<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is generally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
