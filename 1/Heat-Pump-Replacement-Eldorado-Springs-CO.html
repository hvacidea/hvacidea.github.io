<p>I am very pleased with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call service many years earlier and know the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also amazed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an enough temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the home's duct, providing warm air to private bed rooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
