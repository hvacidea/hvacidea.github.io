<p>In homes, the most substantial sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pushed wood products used adhesives which contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood products made for indoor usage include: particleboard (used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furniture); wood plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiberboard (utilized for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiber board includes a greater resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood item and is typically acknowledged as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pushed wood product.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to begin the compressor.
