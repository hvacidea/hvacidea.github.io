<p>Info provided in this security guide is based upon existing scientific and technical understanding of the issues presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional limits established by the statutes governing the co-authoring firms. The standards do not require you to alter your existing central air systems, and replacement parts and services need to still be available for your house's systems. The "life-span" of a central air conditioning conditioner is about 15 to 20 years. Producers typically continue to support existing equipment by making replacement parts readily available and honoring maintenance contracts after the new basic enters into impact.<p>
<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC fridges illegal. 30 DuPont and other companies obstructed the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the method as "that German innovation". 29 31 Nonetheless, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later on Pepsico and others, to create a business coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, four years later, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take actions to support production and usage in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA chose in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-410a, r-134a and r-404a are, as of 2020, being replaced with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and cooling, R-1234yf in vehicles, R-32 in residential cooling and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration. R-600 (isobutane) is currently extensively used in residential refrigeration.<p>
