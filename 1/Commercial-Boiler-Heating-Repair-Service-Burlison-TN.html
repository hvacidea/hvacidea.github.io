<p>It prevails to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as fairly the same physical material over time. In truth, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
