<p>People operating in buildings with bad IAQ might discover moldy or undesirable smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all exposures trigger signs, so there is no replacement for excellent structure management.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes arise from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture. The objective is to offer adequate modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtration that can be installed to achieve this. A common element necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
