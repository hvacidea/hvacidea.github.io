<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside system as near to the house as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<h3>How Central Heating Boilers Maintain Your Buffalo MN Home Toasty Warm</h3>
<p>The kinds of heating ventilation and a/c (HVAC) systems are as different as the different houses they serve (single household houses, duplexes, mobile homes, houses, high-rise condos, row housing, etc.).

For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "low-cost" by many individuals.<p>
