<p>Cooling can also be offered by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is included since the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
