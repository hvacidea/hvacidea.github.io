<h3>HVAC Systems Are Essential for All Homes and Offices in New Braunfels TX</h3>
<p>Ventilating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the procedure of exchanging or changing air in any area to offer high indoor air quality which involves temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of wetness, odors, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne bacteria, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation removes undesirable smells and excessive wetness, presents outside air, keeps interior building air flowing, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
