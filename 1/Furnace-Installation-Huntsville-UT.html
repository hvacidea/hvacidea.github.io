<h3>Typical HVAC Services Offered with a Huntsville UT HVAC Company</h3>
<p>One of the main factors a furnace will run constantly is due to the fact that something is filthy or clogged up Prior to attempting to repair any problem, take time to ensure that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". Check the furnace blower for blocking and tidy it if the air filter is good to go. Have an appearance at the furnace blower motor and oil it if this does not work. If you still can not find out why your furnace keeps running, get in touch with a skilled technician.<p>
<p>Both need to be kept tidy because an air conditioner moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outside coil. This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also required to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately lead to damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
