Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the needed skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair.
