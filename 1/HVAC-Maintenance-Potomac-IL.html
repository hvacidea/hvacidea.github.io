<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outdoors - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heaters are still commonly utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."
