<p>We're Not Just Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Building-Related Disease (BRI) describes less frequent (but often more major) cases of people ending up being ill after being in a specific building at a particular time. In these cases, there is usually a comparable set of clinical signs experienced by the people and a clear cause can often be found upon examination. Legionnaires Illness is an example of BRI triggered by bacteria which can infect a structure's cooling system.<p>
<p>Whether you have central air, a ductless system, or a heatpump, whatever needs to be replaced eventually. As equipment ages, it becomes less efficient.

If your system is near, or past, its anticipated lifespan, replacement might be the most affordable option.<p>

<h3>The Most Common Reasons For Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
