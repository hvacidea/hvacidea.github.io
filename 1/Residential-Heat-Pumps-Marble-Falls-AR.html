During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. However, much of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation.

Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed several years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
