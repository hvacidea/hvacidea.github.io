Packaged systems are great for those wanting to save money on the installation of a brand-new heating & cooling system individually, because the system is combined. However, one con is that these systems are normally just available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a great way to save money on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than buying just a cooling system. Therefore, this may not be the best option for property owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
