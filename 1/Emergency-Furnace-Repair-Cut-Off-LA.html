<p>Chemical contaminants: Unpredictable organic substances ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are many, varied, and ubiquitous. They consist of both human-made and naturally happening chemical substances. Chemical pollutants can include tobacco smoke, emissions from items utilized in the structure (e.g., office devices; flooring, furniture and wall coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and consumer items) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is likewise proof from animal studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. Individuals at particular danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and individuals with asthma and other respiratory illness.<p>
