<p>It is common to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment).

In truth, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
