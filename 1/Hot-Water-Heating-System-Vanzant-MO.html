<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. Initially, you should examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if completely iced over.<p>
