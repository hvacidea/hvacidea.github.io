Our NATE-certified convenience consultants will promptly diagnose any pending problems with your system and offer energy effective services.

<h3>Commercial Boiler Heating Repair in De Soto KS</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in lots. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it suggests the amount of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>They were terrific! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially asked for. They fulfilled my requirements entirely by providing a professional quote with alternatives, without pushing additional items. The team appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also promptly followed up with the necessary evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>

<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service contract tries to upsell you every time they come to perform routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be showing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount rate if she renewed her PMA for seven years, even though it was 6 months before the existing one expired. She didn't need a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>
