<h3>Commercial Boiler Heating Repair in De Soto KS</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in lots. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it suggests the amount of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>They were terrific! Many HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially asked for. They fulfilled my requirements entirely by providing a professional quote with alternatives, without pushing additional items. The team appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The also promptly followed up with the necessary evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly advise this company.<p>

They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, offering her a 10% discount rate if she renewed her PMA for seven years, even though it was 6 months before the existing one expired. She didn't need a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>
