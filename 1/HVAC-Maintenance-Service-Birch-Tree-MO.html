<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance in Birch Tree MO</h3>
<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the task based just on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few affordable ones got. Others were nearly two times the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand equipment. I got Provider. ProTex effectively advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The install group was considerate of my house and set up the equipment in the expected quantity of time. post install examination results look great for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 unit it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>

<h3>Water Heater Thermostat in Birch Tree MO</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in heaps. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it means the amount of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>You must constantly hire a professional to conduct AC repair, for the exact same reason that you trust a professional plumber or electrician.

<p>Have used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
