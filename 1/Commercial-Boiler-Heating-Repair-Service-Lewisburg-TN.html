<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to maintain the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, several research studies through DOE and ACCA can validate this if you're interested.

Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a credible company, you still must do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the exact same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
