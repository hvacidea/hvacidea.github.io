<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of different system types.

<p>A packaged unit, generally set up on the roofing system, is most frequently utilized on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for house owners to consider. Many times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged units are great for those wanting to save cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system separately, considering that the system is integrated. However, one con is that these units are normally just readily available for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be an excellent way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still considerably more expensive than buying simply a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best alternative for homeowners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
