<h3>Tips for Quick Furnace Repair in Eldridge CA</h3>
<p>The icing issue ends up being far more serious with lower outdoor temperature levels, so heat pumps are frequently installed in tandem with a more traditional kind of heating, such as an electrical heater, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is utilized rather of the heatpump during harsher winter season temperatures. In this case, the heatpump is utilized effectively throughout the milder temperature levels, and the system is changed to the traditional heat source when the outside temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, because something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
