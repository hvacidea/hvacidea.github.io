<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and polite. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
