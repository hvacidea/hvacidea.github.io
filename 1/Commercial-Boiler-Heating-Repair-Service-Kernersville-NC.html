<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace at Kernersville NC</h3>
<p>Even more recent heating systems less than 5 years old have actually been discovered as bad. Too many property owners are stunned to discover that their 'new' furnace has a cracked heat exchanger. In some cases it is because of poor furnace style, but in a lot of cases, it's from disregard.

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical product gradually. In reality, the real nature of structures can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
