<p>If you think a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a musty odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it doesn't get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect.

<p>The icing issue ends up being a lot more serious with lower outside temperatures, so heatpump are typically installed in tandem with a more standard type of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a natural gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used rather of the heatpump during harsher winter season temperatures.
