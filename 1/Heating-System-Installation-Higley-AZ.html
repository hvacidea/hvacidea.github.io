<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance at Higley AZ</h3>
<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even little window plan systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be replaced or cleaned as conditions necessitate. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a home with furry pets, will require to have the filters changed regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and greater energy costs; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Additionally, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system and even fire.<p>
<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the space temperature, and after that change it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, try to find an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
