<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Properly maintained heating equipment can last for years. But if you're experiencing frequent breakdowns or your fuel bills unexpectedly appear higher than regular, it is most likely time to think about a new system. New heating devices is much more efficient-- you'll see lower fuel bills right away, not to point out the money you'll save money on repair expenses. If your heating unit is 25 years old or more, you can most likely expect to cut your fuel expenses in half.<p>
