<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are various sizes, however the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, created by construction, for instance, or the burning of fossil fuels, enters into buildings through natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
