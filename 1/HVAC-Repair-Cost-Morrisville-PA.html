If you currently have a house heating unit, you might look for a heat pump more tailored toward cooling capacity and performance. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to search for a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The bright side is that the one major drawback of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the exceptionally hot or cold temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical product over time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
