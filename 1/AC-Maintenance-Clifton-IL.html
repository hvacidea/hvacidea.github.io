<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
