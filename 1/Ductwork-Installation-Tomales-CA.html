<p>Right now, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, building and construction particles, and mold might be living in your house's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe along with the performance of your heating and air conditioning system. There are a number of style approaches in usage today; however, all ground source heatpump run with comparable concepts. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface area systems and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These different heat sources also determine the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>
<p>A SEER ranking represents Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio. The SEER rating of an unit is the cooling output at varying temperatures throughout the cooling season divided by the overall electric energy input during the very same duration. Generally, SEER supplies more information based upon how the EER performs in various temps. The greater the system's SEER ranking, the more energy effective it is. 1 An unit's SEER rating can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag attached to all home appliances.<p>
