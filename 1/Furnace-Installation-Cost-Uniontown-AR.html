There can be a serious risk from the cumulative impacts of these sources.

<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange devices normally lasts years, since it is protected inside your home. When it does need to be replaced, the cost is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most costly to set up. New technical standards get rid of the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat in time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that you might want to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heat pump systems can have various heating and cooling capacities. If you currently have a house heater, you might search for a heatpump more tailored toward cooling capacity and effectiveness. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling requirements, you'll naturally want to try to find a design that will have adequate heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. Fortunately is that the one significant drawback of heat pumps is that they can fail in the very hot or cold temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
