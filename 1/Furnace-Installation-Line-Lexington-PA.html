<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. Initially, you must check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
