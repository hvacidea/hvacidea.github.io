Depending on the kind of unit set up, it can be noisy and cause issues if you're extremely adverse dust.

Throughout use, there is a dead time while heat is being transported from the heating unit to the home.<p>
<p>Indoor air contamination comes from a range of sources; the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recognized building materials, home furnishings, and mold as major issues, but much of the danger also originates from burning things.
