<p>Duct cleaning is a needed service some people mistake for a high-end. In our digital age, it is simple to research study companies and their track records.

<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall.

Since they don't need any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Since a system is set up in each room or location you wish to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>
