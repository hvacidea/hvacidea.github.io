<p>Radiant heating covers a range of different heating systems, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on similar concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each space.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably the same physical product over time. In truth, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as complex systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
