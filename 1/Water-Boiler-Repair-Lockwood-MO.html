<p>The directions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the very same. As soon as the electrical wiring is total, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively cure and harden-- usually 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
