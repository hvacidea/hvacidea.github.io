<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential structures has ended up being a crucial concern to house owners and health professionals.

<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, but to have two significant components stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice before work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
