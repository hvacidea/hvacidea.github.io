<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which houses are developed.

The maintenance. service technicians will assess all of these aspects of the furnace and carefully and eliminate all obstructions and traces of soot.<p>
<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
