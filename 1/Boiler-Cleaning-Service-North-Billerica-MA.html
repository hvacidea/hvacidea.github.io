<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have heard of the $5000 rule however got ta offer whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and provided clear interaction about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly utilize Stability Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>
