<p>When our furnace was passing away, we got in touch with 2 local companies for quotes. While both were useful and helpful, Ballard Gas gave us a better deal, for exceptional service. Instead of a simple sales task, the owner of the company made a complete assessment of our heating unit and located ways we might have more even heat. He included these considerable but minor modifications in his quote. Because of current warmer summers and for ecological factors, we chose to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
