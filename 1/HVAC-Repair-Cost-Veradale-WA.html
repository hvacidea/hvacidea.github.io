<p>Correct ventilation assists enhance indoor air quality. It's easy to believe that the air quality outside is worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we might even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, nevertheless, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outside levels, and sometimes these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outdoor levels of the same contaminants. Simply put, often the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can trigger a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too clogged, the heat exchanger will overheat and shut off too rapidly, and your home won't warm up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A filthy filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
