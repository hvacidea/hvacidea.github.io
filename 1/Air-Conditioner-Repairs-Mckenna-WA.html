<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you should look out for. First, you need to examine your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little unreasonable, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
