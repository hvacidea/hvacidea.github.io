<p>Direct Exposure Control: Adjusting the time and place of toxin exposure. An example of time control is scheduling floor waxing and removing (with the ventilation system working) on a Friday. This enables items to off-gas over the weekend while most of the personnel are at home over the weekend. Place control involves moving the toxin source far from residents or even relocating vulnerable occupants.<p>
<p>Whatever heater you set up, it's essential that it's sized properly for your home. Too big and you'll be paying more for devices and installation than you should. Plus, it will utilize too much energy for the amount of heat you want produced. If the system is too small, then your house will not be warmed effectively and the system will need to continuously go to attempt to heat the whole home, which will increase heating costs.<p>
<p>The most dangerous asbestos fibers are too little to be noticeable. After they are breathed in, they can stay and build up in the lungs. Asbestos can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal linings), and asbestosis (permanent lung scarring that can be deadly). Symptoms of these diseases do not show up till many years after exposure began. Many people with asbestos-related diseases were exposed to raised concentrations on the job; some industrialized disease from exposure to clothing and devices brought house from task websites.<p>
