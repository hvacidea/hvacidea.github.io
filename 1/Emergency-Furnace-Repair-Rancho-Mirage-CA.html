<p>A/c can also be provided by a process called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
