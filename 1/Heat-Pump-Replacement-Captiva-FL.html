<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Design, Construction and Commissioning is created for architects, design engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other experts worried about indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home include structure materials, cigarette smoking, household items, and using unvented, fuel-burning home appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene area heating units. Formaldehyde, by itself or in mix with other chemicals, serves a variety of purposes in made items. For example, it is used to add permanent-press qualities to clothing and draperies, as a part of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and coating items.<p>
<p>For example, issues develop when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to generate appropriate quantities of outside air. Insufficient ventilation also occurs if the air supply and return vents within each space are obstructed or put in such a way that outdoor air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of structure occupants. Poorly located outside air intake vents can likewise bring in air contaminated with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from toilets. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading out biological pollutants that have multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioning system, or the within surfaces of ventilation duct.<p>

More serious than most allergenic properties is the ability of mold to activate episodes face to faces that already have asthma, a major breathing illness.<p>
