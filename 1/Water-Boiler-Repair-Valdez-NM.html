<p>A 3rd way to choose whether your house may have bad indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be significant sources of indoor air contamination. Lastly, try to find signs of issues with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can show your house might not have sufficient ventilation include moisture condensation on windows or walls, foul-smelling or stuffy air, unclean central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other products become moldy. To detect odors in your house, step outside for a few minutes, and after that upon reentering your house, note whether smells are obvious.<p>
<p>Over the previous few years, there has been some promotion recommending that houseplants have been shown to reduce levels of some chemicals in laboratory experiments. There is currently no proof, however, that a sensible number of houseplants remove significant quantities of contaminants in workplaces and homes. Indoor houseplants should not be over-watered because extremely moist soil might promote the development of microorganisms which can affect allergic individuals.<p>
