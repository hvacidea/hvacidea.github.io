<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between a outdoor and indoor unit rather of ducting air directly from the outside system.

<p>Inspect these three things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your house are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The minimized airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's great airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
