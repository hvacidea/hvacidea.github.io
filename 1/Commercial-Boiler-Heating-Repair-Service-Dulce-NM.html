<h3>The Annals of Air Source Heat Pumps in Dulce NM</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems require relatively little attention. But, just like any mechanical system, some standard maintenance is essential to keep the system working smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit are similar to those of traditional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and storage tank need to be checked for leakages, the system needs to be flushed periodically to get rid of tank and collected impurities (scaling in tough water areas). The systems need to be examined at least twice per year for an appropriate operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be washed regularly to remove dust collected in order to improve collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
