<p>Terrific Product! Delivery was type of strange being that package was opened and items could have fell out. But after review of contents we guaranteed it was all undamaged. The item was very lite weight and requires time to apply. Keep in mind: buy recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we solved concerns. I would recommend this product to anybody who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>

<h3>Commercial HVAC in Berkley MI</h3>
<p>I typically do not leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You do not anticipate needing to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other choice. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my choices. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about options. I arranged my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their method. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
