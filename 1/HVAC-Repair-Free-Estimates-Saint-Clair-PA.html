<p>EER stands for Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy performance of central air systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Usually the most efficient way to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of specific sources of pollution or to decrease their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be gotten used to reduce the amount of emissions. In most cases, source control is also a more affordable method to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy expenses. Particular sources of indoor air contamination in your house are listed later in this section.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you ought to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
