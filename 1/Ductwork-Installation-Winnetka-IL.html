<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid droplets and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs.
