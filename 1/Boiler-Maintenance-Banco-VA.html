<p>A/c can also be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
