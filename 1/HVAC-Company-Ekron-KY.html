<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning at Ekron KY</h3>
<p>I admit I have not done the mathematics recently, but I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years.

Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the system sits. I feel like they offer me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
