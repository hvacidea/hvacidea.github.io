<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound given that 1978. The selection of indoor units has one restriction: their total power must not go beyond the capacity of the outside system. In practice, however, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units higher than the outdoor capability by a minimum of 20%. However, it is incorrect to expect better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the exact same time, because the total capacity of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outside unit. Basically, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that a few of the rooms might not have a really comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the total power is not easy, since it takes into consideration not just the nominal power of the units, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>Whether you have central air, a ductless system, or a heat pump, everything needs to be changed eventually. As devices ages, it becomes less efficient.

If your system is near, or past, its expected life expectancy, replacement might be the most affordable option.<p>
