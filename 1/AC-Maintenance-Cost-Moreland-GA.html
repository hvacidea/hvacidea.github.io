<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady gradually. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical material over time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
