<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outdoors - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summertime. These convection heaters are still extensively utilized and are usually called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating element in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>The first air conditioners and refrigerators employed harmful or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might result in fatal accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular composition (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion house and building comfort cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
