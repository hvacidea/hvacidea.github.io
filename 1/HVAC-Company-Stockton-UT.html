Due to the fact that they do not need any new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions. Since an unit is set up in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature in the room when you are present.<p>
