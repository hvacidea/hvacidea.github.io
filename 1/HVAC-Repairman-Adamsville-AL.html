Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the traditional hot water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut off completely.<p>
<p>A ducted heatpump appears like a big central air conditioning conditioner unit that sits outside your house. Heat pumps operate on electrical energy and work like air conditioners in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.
