<p>Asthmatic children are specifically at risk. EPA estimates that direct exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the number of episodes and intensity of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and might cause thousands of nonasth-matic children to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition made worse by direct exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Direct exposure to secondhand smoke causes throat, nose, and eye irritation. It might affect the cardiovascular system and some research studies have linked direct exposure to secondhand smoke with the beginning of chest discomfort.
