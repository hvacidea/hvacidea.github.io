Many pieces of a furnace or a/c unit do not just break at the snap of a finger, but rather is the outcome of repeated use of a part that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger might stop working too soon since the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering early degeneration, resulting in holes and fractures. , if that customer had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the component.. an extremely advantageous outcome and one that was no charge at the time of service, but one that potentially conserved a customer thousands.<p>
