<p>All houses need effective ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others.

<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a tough job that the employees sweat and bleed at, particularly residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps men working. When a sales male concerns your house he is there to sell, that is the only method he is paid. You have a great Tech PM your system, he is paying bills and must not "require" to offer you something you do not need. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I give you the choices for your requirements and you decide if you require it.<p>

We had bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.)

We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to evaluate AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
