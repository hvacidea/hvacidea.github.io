<p>At present, EPA does not recommend utilizing air cleaners to decrease levels of radon and its decay items. Due to the fact that they only partly get rid of the radon decay products and do not reduce the quantity of radon entering the home, the effectiveness of these devices is unpredictable.

EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, provides more details on air-cleaning gadgets to lower indoor air toxins.<p>
