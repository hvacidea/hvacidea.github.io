<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air.

Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide ought to be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements used for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements.
