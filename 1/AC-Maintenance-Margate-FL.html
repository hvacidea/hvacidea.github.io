<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals.

Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pressing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept them until they have actually been correctly dried. If products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a different dry cleaner.<p>
