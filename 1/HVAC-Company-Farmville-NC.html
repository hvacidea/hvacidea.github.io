<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must momentarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
