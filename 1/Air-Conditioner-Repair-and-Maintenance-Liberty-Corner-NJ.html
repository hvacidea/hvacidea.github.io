<p>EER represents Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy performance of central air systems is measured by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people do not utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Lots of AC systems include a variety of unique features that can further enhance efficiency and performance. For example, homeowners might wish to search for one that features an integrated filter light that will inform you when the air filter needs to be changed. Another popular function to try to find is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on at night to minimize energy costs much more. Of course, more features imply greater central air costs.<p>
<p>Depending upon where in the United States your house lies, the local area's environment can alter dramatically. A home located in the South would need an AC system with a size capable of cooling your home due to high temperature Summers. A home in the Northern part of the US would require a much bigger heating capability too which will impact expenses. See the chart below for the typical central air conditioning conditioner replacement expenses by LOADS.<p>
