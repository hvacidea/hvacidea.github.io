<p>A packaged unit, normally set up on the roofing, is most frequently used on commercial structures, however it is also an alternative for homeowners to think about. Often times, these units include not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged units are excellent for those seeking to save cash on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system independently, considering that the system is integrated. However, one con is that these units are normally only readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capability.
