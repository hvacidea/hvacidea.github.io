<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as an Essential Service in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are rated 90% efficiency or better; it is not unusual for a modern furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older models, which may be rated as low as 80% effectiveness, this can indicate substantial cost savings in yearly heating expenses. Modern two- and three-stage heaters increase performance even further by running at lower or greater capacity depending upon the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>A routine furnace tune up can make the most of effectiveness and provide longer lasting home heating. Nevertheless, there are times when a basic maintenance call can recognize an issue that will need a substantial investment to treat. Then, it's decision time. Do you make the costly repair and enjoy continued convenience from your existing heating unit? Or, do you make an even larger financial commitment to changing the furnace? The decision to change or repair depends on you, and typically it's a matter of comparing the cost to repair, taking into account the age of the equipment, versus the cost of a new furnace that likely provides greater energy efficiency and features service warranty protection.<p>
