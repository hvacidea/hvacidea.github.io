<p>The most typical type of house heater in the U.S. burns gas or propane to produce heat. With a typical cost that ranges from $2,500 to $14,000 to install, they are not the least pricey option, however newer systems can be very energy efficient. According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems normally accomplish a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while more recent, highly efficient natural gas heaters can attain AFUE rankings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have problems, they offer me concern and a lower rate. Bought a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Excellent investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I do not require.<p>
