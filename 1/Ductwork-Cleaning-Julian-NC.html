The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air helps and dilutes indoor pollutants tire them from the home.<p>
