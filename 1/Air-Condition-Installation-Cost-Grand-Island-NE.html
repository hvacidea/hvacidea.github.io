<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
