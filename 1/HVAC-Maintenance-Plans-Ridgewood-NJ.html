<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most recent science for NO2.

<p>Indoor pollutants. These consist of chemicals utilized in the construction or restoration of structures (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning substances). In addition, devices that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Incomplete combustion and poor ventilation of these devices (cook ranges, gas heating systems, gas boilers, and gas water heaters) can add to indoor impurities. Gas cook tops need to be utilized with fans that send out exhaust exterior. Gas-fired heating home appliances should be sealed and power-vented systems installed to remove items of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning ranges can likewise create particulates and must be vented outside.<p>
