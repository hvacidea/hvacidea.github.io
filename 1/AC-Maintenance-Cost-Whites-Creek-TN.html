<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the conventional water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the standard hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the conventional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the standard water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>

And although the devices and methods used by duct-cleaning companies have actually altered given that these studies were performed, the air ducts in homes have not.<p>
