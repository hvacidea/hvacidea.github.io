<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. The quality of air in residential structures has become an important concern to homeowners and health specialists. Indoor air pollution research studies have determined several contaminants that can be present in indoor air. These consist of combustion items, unpredictable natural substances (including formaldehyde), tobacco smoke, bioaerosols, and pesticides. Appropriate ventilation and removal of the sources of these pollutants are very important in preserving great indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price terrific but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
