However, it is incorrect to anticipate much better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the same time, since the overall capacity of the entire system is limited by the capability of the outside unit. Put simply, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that a few of the rooms might not have an extremely comfy temperature level.
