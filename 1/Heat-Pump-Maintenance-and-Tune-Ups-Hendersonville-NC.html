<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical product over time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
