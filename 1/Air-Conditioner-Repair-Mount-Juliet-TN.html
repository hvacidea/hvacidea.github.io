He knew just what the issue was and repaired it very quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is caused by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary path of exposure is through the production of an aerosol effect, the majority of commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly positioned or kept evaporative cooling towers, which frequently release water in an aerosol which might go into neighboring ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical centers and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis.
