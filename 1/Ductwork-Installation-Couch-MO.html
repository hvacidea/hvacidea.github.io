<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - smog, ozone, or haze hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. These convection heating units are still commonly used and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>More common in relatively older houses, a boiler-based heating system utilizes electrical energy, gas or oil to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipes to heat radiators in specific rooms.
