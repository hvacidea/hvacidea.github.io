<p>We look at hints before we offer advice to change rather than repair a heating system. One of the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are higher every year, we know the system is not running effectively. It may be in perfect condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be losing cash by not changing the older unit.<p>
