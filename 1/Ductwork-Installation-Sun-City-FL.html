<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the task based only on e-mails, appeared and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the couple of reasonable ones got. Others were almost two times the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install team was considerate of my house and installed the devices in the expected amount of time. post install evaluation outcomes look excellent for braising and pipes quality.

<p>7 To check it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the room temperature, and then change it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioning system's compressor, wait a minimum of 5 minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
