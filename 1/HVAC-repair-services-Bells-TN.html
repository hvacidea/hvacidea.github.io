<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a fairly easy to measure surrogate for indoor pollutants released by humans, and associates with human metabolic activity. Carbon dioxide at levels that are abnormally high inside your home may trigger occupants to grow drowsy, to get headaches, or to work at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are generally 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 People are the primary indoor source of co2 in most structures.

<p>When all the jobs have actually been completed, the last task is to check the system to make certain it cools successfully. HVAC systems are run through the thermostat.

Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save cash by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you pick them up, do decline them until they have actually been appropriately dried.
