<p>Central air systems are measured in loads. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 lot system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>

If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy expenses are higher year after year, we know the system is not running efficiently. It may be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient model, then you would be squandering money by not replacing the older unit.<p>
