<p>A health survey should be established and dispersed to all concerned workers.

<p>In addition, worker health symptoms such as colds, headaches, sleepiness, irritation, and irregular breathing might be brought on as the result of temperature level extremes, inappropriate humidity levels, and too much or too little air flow.
