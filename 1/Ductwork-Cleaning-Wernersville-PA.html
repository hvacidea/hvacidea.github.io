Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

Till 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER.
