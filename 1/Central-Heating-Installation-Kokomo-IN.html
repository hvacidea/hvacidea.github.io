<p>A/c can also be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
