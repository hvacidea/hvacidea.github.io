<p>I am replacing our High Speed System since of a serious refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Convenience Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including three (3) high speed supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise recycle the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise install a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an option for an additional $2,818.00 to set up a Carrier Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both rated at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, however numerous utilize the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is most likely a better option.

<p>After the system has actually been checked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers ought to be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be secured by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside ought to be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
