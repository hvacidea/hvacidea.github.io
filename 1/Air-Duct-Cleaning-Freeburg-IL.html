<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't offer them.  Secondly like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be completely made the most of. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to correctly service and the system has actually been running problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
