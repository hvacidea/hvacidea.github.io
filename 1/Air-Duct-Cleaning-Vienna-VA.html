If your house is not heating up, just be concerned. However, if your system does not appear to be working appropriately, check outside to see if your system is frozen or covered in ice. This would be a circumstances where you should call in an expert to repair the unit and check.<p>

The Guideline prohibited using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and kept.<p>
