<p>I have actually been utilizing them for many years for my companies, my own houses and my property clients' homes. I went through 5 other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who described to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. He assisted me problem shoot the concern when I called and he recommended me to get in touch with warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the unit working again. He is sincere, reliable, and sensible on price. It's tough to discover an honest AC person and I'm glad I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
<p>The installation was fast, professional and effectively done. The installers were courteous and understood exactly what to do.

<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have issues, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended warranties or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to offer me something I don't need.<p>
