<h3>Advantages of Purchasing on Gas Furnaces in Alton IL</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, conducted a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy costs by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
