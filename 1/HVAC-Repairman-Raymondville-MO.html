<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the very same day.

I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>

<h3>AC Maintenance Cost in Raymondville MO</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring area less than 20 sq. ft., you might (in most cases) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and nuisance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a devoted circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
