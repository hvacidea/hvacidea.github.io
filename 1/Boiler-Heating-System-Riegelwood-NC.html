The temperature of the inbound air is lowered, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite significant.<p>

<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning system works but your home does not cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
