<h3>Home Air Conditioning Service in Cypress TX</h3>

<p>3. Gas Heaters While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is typically higher than lots of heatpump options, they can still be extremely effective, depending upon the model you purchase. One of the main advantages of gas heating is that due to the combustion procedure, it will heat the air to greater temperatures than other heating alternatives. This means it can heat up your house to the wanted temperature level quicker than a heatpump can.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must temporarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
