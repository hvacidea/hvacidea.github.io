<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Your Evaluation This is my third time using All the time.

I have absolutely nothing but fantastic things to say - he has actually taken excellent care of my heating and AC requirements. Quick reaction - quick resolution.<p>
<p>Over the previous few years, there has actually been some publicity suggesting that houseplants have been revealed to decrease levels of some chemicals in lab experiments. There is presently no evidence, however, that a reasonable number of houseplants remove significant amounts of pollutants in offices and homes. Since excessively damp soil might promote the development of bacteria which can impact allergic individuals, indoor houseplants need to not be over-watered.<p>
