<p>Expert heater installations. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating system will eventually stop working. HVAC specialists suggest following this standard guideline when deciding whether it deserves buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the price of a new system, it's best to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than required.<p>

The quality of indoor air will be impacted if one or more of these procedures are underperforming.<p>
