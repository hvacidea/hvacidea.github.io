<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the rate excellent but Mark went out of his method to customize a few things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
