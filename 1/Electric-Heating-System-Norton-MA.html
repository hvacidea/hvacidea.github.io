<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is absorbed by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid distributes around this loop, transferring the soaked up heat to a refrigerant by means of the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas.

From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating system.<p>
