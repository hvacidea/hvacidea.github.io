<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.

To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs managed by specialists, see Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
