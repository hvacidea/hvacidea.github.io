Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 trips to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the system sits. I feel like they provide me favoritism, and want to pay a little more for that comfort.<p>
<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things initially. Ensure all the signs up in your house are broad open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the minimized air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You have actually resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
