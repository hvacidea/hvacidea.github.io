<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
