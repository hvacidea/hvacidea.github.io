<p>Power Vac America supplies commercial, industrial, institutional, marine and residential duct cleaning and HVAC system cleaning services. The key portion of your air conditioning is the outside system. Without it, you have no cooling. Depending upon its placement on your residential or commercial property and its upkeep, it might sustain some damage during the winter. Most of the time, this simply includes some buildup of dirt and debris, which is pretty easy to get rid of. Your Sacramento HVAC technician will clean off the outside of the system and make sure that there is no rust, damage from accumulated wetness, or extreme wear to the outside. They may recommend that you trim back thick trees or bushes to ensure adequate airflow around the system.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a variety of different heating unit, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats up by distributing warm water through a series of pipes set up in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

<p>If you think a mold issue-- either because of noticeable growth or a musty odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and examine. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you think a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leakages.<p>
