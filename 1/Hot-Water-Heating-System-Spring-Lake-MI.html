<p>Examine these three things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in your home are wide open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The decreased air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several registers were closed or the filter was obstructed. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or till there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the issue.<p>
