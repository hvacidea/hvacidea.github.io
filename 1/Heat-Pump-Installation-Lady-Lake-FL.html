<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Lady Lake FL</h3>
<p>All contemporary cooling systems, even small window package systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be replaced or cleaned as conditions require.

Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. Furthermore, very unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
