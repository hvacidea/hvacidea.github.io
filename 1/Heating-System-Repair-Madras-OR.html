We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as relatively the same physical material over time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
