<p>How climate modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a standard modus operandi for modern a/c unit) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit increase. This increase has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c removes that energy. 39 To do so, the ac system need to increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the air conditioning system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
