<p>Professional heater setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating unit will eventually stop working. HVAC experts recommend following this basic rule when deciding whether it deserves buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a new system, it's best to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than required.<p>
<p>An AC system maintenance cost can be $50 to $110 for a single visit, or you can register for a maintenance plan with your local heating and air conditioning company. That will cost about $150 to $300 a year. You'll get one or two maintenance check outs per year, plus another service call, a discount rate on parts, and typically some other advantages. Some companies use priority visits to their maintenance plan members.<p>
