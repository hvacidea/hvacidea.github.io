These are generally of a lightweight gauze-like product, and must be replaced or washed as conditions call for.

Failure to change these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Furthermore, really unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
