<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not offer them.. Secondly like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the task and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be completely taken advantage of. The majority of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to appropriately service and the unit has actually been running issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
