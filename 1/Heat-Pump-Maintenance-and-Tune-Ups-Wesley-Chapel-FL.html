Although he didn't have the required replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he could look for and buy it the next morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was absolutely happy to have a heated home once again. What's most amazing was that this all occurred during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find somebody to help us right prior to a vacation, but Climate Pro came through for us. I will happily advise this company to my good friends.<p>
