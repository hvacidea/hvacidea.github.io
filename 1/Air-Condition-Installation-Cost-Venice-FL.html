<p>Next, and maybe just as important when it pertains to central air costs, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time eliminating humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not have the ability to properly cool the house on hot days. Thinking about bigger systems cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air system needs to hold.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to briefly switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
