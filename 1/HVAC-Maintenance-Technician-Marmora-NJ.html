<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system need to briefly change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
