Perhaps it is time to begin thinking about purchasing a brand-new one if your furnace is in a really bad condition.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outside unit as near to your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
