<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Contractor in University Place</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as an Essential Business in Los Angeles. Today's heaters are ranked 90% efficiency or better; it is not unusual for a modern-day furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older models, which might be ranked as low as 80% performance, this can mean considerable savings in annual heating expenses. Modern two- and three-stage furnaces increase effectiveness even further by running at lower or greater capability depending on the heating requirements of the area.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor unit as near your house as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
