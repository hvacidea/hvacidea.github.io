<p>Today, countless dust mites, dead skin cells, building particles, and mold may be living in your home's air ducts, impacting the air you breathe in addition to the performance of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on many people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a recent survey by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground. But a number of the important things individuals do-- or don't do-- can contribute to the stew of airborne impurities in their homes and intensify asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>York HVAC systems are considered among the best brands especially because they are understood for their value prices. The average cost to install a YORK air conditioner with a 16 SEER score would cost around $3,200 to set up.

<p>Re-install the gain access to panel and disconnect block. Switch on the breaker and furnace switch. Then set the thermostat to a lower temperature level and await the AC to start (see Be Patient at Startup," below). The compressor needs to run and the condenser fan ought to spin.

If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
