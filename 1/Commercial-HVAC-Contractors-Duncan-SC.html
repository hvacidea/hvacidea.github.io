<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the cost excellent but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the general air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
<h3>Electric Furnace in Duncan South Carolina</h3>
<p>My home has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this person belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the property.<p>

<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System due to the fact that of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be utilizing the above noted equipment, a Provider, Comfort Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise installing an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be including three (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will also reuse the refrigerant lines and evacuate the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will also set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an option for an extra $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>There is no simple answer, however many utilize the general rule that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is probably a much better option. If the existing system has actually not sustained other major repairs, is in otherwise outstanding condition, and problems that led to the breakdown can be recognized and corrected, repairing the unit can make a lot of sense too.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air contamination. For example, people breathe out co2, which in small quantities is not hazardous, however may become hazardous if high concentrations are enabled to build up. Micro-organisms or bacteria might likewise exist within the ventilation system. If micro-organisms do develop, they might spread throughout the whole work environment or structure by methods of the ventilation system.<p>
