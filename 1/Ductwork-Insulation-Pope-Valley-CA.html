Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
