An example of time control is scheduling flooring waxing and removing (with the ventilation system operating) on a Friday.

Location control includes moving the pollutant source away from residents or even transferring vulnerable residents.<p>

Although there are risks connected with the task, it is normally carried out securely as long as correct care is taken.<p>

<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more difficult to control than they appear due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity ought to be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
