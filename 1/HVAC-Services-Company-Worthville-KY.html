<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 should be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may likewise be required.<p>
<p>The main factor homeowners do not buy an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 each year, depending upon the amount of services provided. The cost may not be worthwhile if the system is brand-new and still under a manufacturer's guarantee. Any major repairs should be covered under the producer's service warranty. However, some makers require regular maintenance as a term of the warranty.<p>
