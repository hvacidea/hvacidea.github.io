<h3>Central Air Conditioning Repair in Valencia California</h3>
<p>If you believe a mold problem-- either because of noticeable growth or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Leaking return ducts can also introduce wetness. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

Wetness management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to save energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the greater temperature levels often used to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the United States and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to supply thermal comfort inside your home. However, high humidity outdoors develops the need for careful attention to humidity levels inside your home. High humidities give rise to mold growth and wetness inside your home is associated with a higher prevalence of occupant respiratory problems.<p>
<p>Considering that cooling and heating work may likewise need setting up or repairing plumbing to supply oil or natural gas to heating devices, an HVAC contractor might likewise be needed to hold a separate plumbing technician's license or have a certified plumber on call. However, some jurisdictions license HVAC contractors specifically for this kind of work. When getting a quote, make sure to ask not only if a company is accredited, but also what type of license it holds.<p>
