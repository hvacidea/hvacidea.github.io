<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the warmth naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioner works but your home does not cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
