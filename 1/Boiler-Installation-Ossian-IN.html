<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

Any interference or interruption in the circulation of electrical power makes the system unusable. This is one of the drawbacks to installing an electric convected heat system. Nevertheless, assuming they are installed correctly and effectively looked after, the likelihood of them having problems is little.<p>
