I did not trouble to get competitor's quotes because of my trust in Waychoff because the cost was undoubtedly affordable.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.  Second of all like prolonged vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to treat clients fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. Many companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to offer new versus repair.
