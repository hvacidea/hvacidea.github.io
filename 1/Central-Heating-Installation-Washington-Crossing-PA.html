If the signs fade or go away when a person is far from the home and return when the individual returns, an effort needs to be made to recognize indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some effects may be made worse by an inadequate supply of outside air or from the cooling, humidity, or heating conditions widespread in the home.<p>
<p>Our indoor air quality professionals can convert your heating and cooling system into a whole-house air treatment center. To lower pollutants, we suggest installing sophisticated air cleaning systems like MicroPower Guard filters, which are developed to get rid of the smallest particles from the air.

<p>Structures are created or planned to respond actively to some of these modifications in and around them with heating, cooling, aerating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean up, sanitize, and keep surface areas to enhance their longevity, efficiency, or look. In other cases, such changes subtly or perhaps drastically modify structures in ways that may be important to their own stability or their influence on building occupants through the advancement of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that specify them at any time. We may find it useful to integrate the tools of the physical sciences with those of the biological sciences and, specifically, a few of the techniques used by scientists studying ecosystems, in order to gain an improved understanding of the environments in which we invest the majority of our time, our buildings.<p>

<p>The primary health result associated with exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may position risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is particularly high.<p>
