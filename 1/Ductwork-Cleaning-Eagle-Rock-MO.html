<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all significant devices producer's to guarantee your factory service warranties remain in place. In addition, the tangible results of a PM is typically difficult to quantify, as one reaction specified the cost savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. Most pieces of a furnace or air conditioner do not simply break at the snap of a finger, however instead is the result of repeated use of a component that is out of balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working prematurely because the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature degeneration, resulting in fractures and holes. If that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and protects the element.  a really useful outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, however one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
