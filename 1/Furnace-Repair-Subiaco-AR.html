<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor in Subiaco AR</h3>
<p>Developed to enhance making process control in a printing plant, Carrier's innovation controlled not only temperature however likewise humidity Carrier used his knowledge of the heating of things with steam and reversed the procedure. Instead of sending out air through hot coils, he sent it through cold coils (filled with cold water). The air was cooled, and thus the amount of moisture in the air might be managed, which in turn made the humidity in the space controllable. The controlled temperature level and humidity helped maintain constant paper measurements and ink positioning. Later, Carrier's technology was used to increase performance in the work environment, and The Carrier Cooling Company of America was formed to meet rising demand. Over time, cooling became used to improve comfort in autos and houses as well.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
