The choice of indoor units has one limitation: their total power needs to not surpass the capability of the outdoor unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor systems greater than the outside capability by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect much better performance when all indoor systems are switched on at the same time, considering that the overall capacity of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outdoor unit. Put simply, the outside unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that a few of the spaces might not have an extremely comfy temperature level.
