The company started in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature customers for decades, till the mandate for high-efficiency units forced Goettl to end production. The contracting side of the business continued under several owners. Goodrich's daddy was a Goettl dealership in Las Vegas, so when the chance came to buy what was left of the firm in 2013, he took it.<p>
<p>The lifespan of a central air conditioning system is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning system are more energy effective than models made even 5 years earlier, so it makes financial sense to change or update your unit if it's 5 years old or older.

Generally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, particularly if the goal of owning a business was for monetary liberty. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it took to construct the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% generally isn't completion objective. HVAC company owner should strive for 10-15% by cutting expenses in some areas or increasing their earnings while keeping costs the exact same in all other areas.<p>
