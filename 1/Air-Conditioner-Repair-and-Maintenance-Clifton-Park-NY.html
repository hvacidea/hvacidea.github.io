<p>I am replacing our High Velocity System due to the fact that of a major refrigerant with the old refrigerant, R-11. The installer will be using the above noted equipment, a Carrier, Comfort Series Single Phase Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are also setting up an Unico single Stage Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding three (3) high velocity supply lines and reuse the existing 17 supply lines. They will likewise reuse the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and replace with a R410 refrigerant. They will also set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I likewise have a choice for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Efficiency Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>
<p>There is no simple response, but many use the guideline that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is probably a much better option. If the current system has not incurred other major repairs, remains in otherwise outstanding condition, and issues that caused the breakdown can be determined and fixed, repairing the system can make a lot of sense too.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine parts. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by specialists, check out Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
