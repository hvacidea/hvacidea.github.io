<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat increases, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the floor level.

<h3>How Does a Heat Pump Work in Windsor Mill MD?</h3>
<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' trigger an issue in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
