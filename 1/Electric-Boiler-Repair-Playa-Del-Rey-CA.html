<p>While radon in water is not a problem in homes served by many public water products, it has been found in well water. If you've checked the air in your home and discovered a radon problem, and you have a well, contact a lab certified to measure radiation in water to have your water tested. Radon problems in water can be easily repaired. Call your state radon workplace or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to learn more.<p>
<p>HVAC is a vital part of residential structures such as single household houses, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to large industrial and office complex such as health centers and skyscrapers, vehicles such as automobiles, trains, submarines, airplanes and ships, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy structure conditions are regulated with regard to temperature level and humidity, utilizing fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Lots of AC systems feature a number of unique features that can further improve performance and efficiency. For example, property owners may wish to try to find one that includes a built-in filter light that will alert you when the air filter needs to be altered. Another popular feature to try to find is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on at night to lower energy costs much more. Obviously, more functions suggest greater central air conditioning costs.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil soaks up heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, dripping into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is generally routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
