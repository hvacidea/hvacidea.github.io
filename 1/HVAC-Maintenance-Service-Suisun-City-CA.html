<h3>Forced Air Furnace in Suisun City California</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an additional $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

Prior to deciding whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower systems, your technician needs to run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and determining how much air gets away the system.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a reference later on).

The female crimp ports ought to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
