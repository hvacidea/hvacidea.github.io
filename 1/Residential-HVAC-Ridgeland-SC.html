<p>, if the hvac company didn't come out ahead they would not offer agreements.. The so called reputable companies swindle more people than the fly by night clothing. I know due to the fact that I tried to work for them. Due to the fact that 90% of them are criminals, I quit. They walk in with or without a contract and begin selling you things you don't require. They lie. How do I know. I now work as a consultant to verify the so called problems and treatments. 9 out of 10, I check are completely wrong.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just 8 to 10 years old, it could suck up to two times the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's because it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to provide a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment set up just a couple of years back.<p>
