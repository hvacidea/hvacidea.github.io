<p>Award Winning Pipes and HVAC Services. Numerous common structure products used prior to 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some flooring tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Usually, significant releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the building products are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building remodelling.
