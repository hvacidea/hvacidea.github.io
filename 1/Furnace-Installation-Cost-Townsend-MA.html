<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heatpump, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heat pump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, in addition to the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>

In late winter season and early spring, it may still be too cold to throw open the windows to take out the musty air, so while you wait for the warmer weather condition it is necessary to be aware of a few of the allergic reaction and respiratory triggers that may be lurking in your environments.<p>

The quality of indoor air will be affected if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
