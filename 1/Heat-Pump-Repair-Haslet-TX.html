It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular inspections. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded immediately, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 trips to collaborate their work with a company that was working on the outdoor patio where the system sits. I feel like they give me favoritism, and want to pay a little bit more for that assurance.<p>
