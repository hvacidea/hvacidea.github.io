<p>Chemical toxins: Unpredictable natural substances ( VOCs) are natural chemicals. VOCs are numerous, differed, and common. They include both human-made and naturally occurring chemical compounds. Chemical pollutants can include tobacco smoke, emissions from products utilized in the structure (e.g., workplace devices; wall, floor and furniture coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer items) unexpected spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide gas and nitrogen dioxide, which are products of combustion.<p>
<p>This is particularly notable, as gas ranges can cause levels of pollution that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with poorly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more difficult to manage than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunlight, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity must be kept at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to minimize mold development.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in sufficient outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air toxins out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
