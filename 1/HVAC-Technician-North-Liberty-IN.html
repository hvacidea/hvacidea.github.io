<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Must Know Before Buying in North Liberty IN</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, carried out a study in the 1990s to examine 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by enhancing air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels really increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
