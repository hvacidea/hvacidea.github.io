<p>SysTech Style specializes in industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and preserving the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils.

<p>Place the solar storage tank near the standard hot water heater.

If the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be changed, install unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut.<p>
