<h3>How to Receive Your HVAC Certification and HVAC Licensing in Canehill AR</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. In some cases, determined particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
