There are emergency security changes that protect your a/c system from flooding. One of the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a great chance; you might have a water leakage in the attic.
