<p>Central air conditioning units are measured in lots. This measurement is based upon the system's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 heap system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it implies the quantity of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.

When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine could damage the engine elements. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator requires dealt with by experts, go to Eric's Garage today.<p>
