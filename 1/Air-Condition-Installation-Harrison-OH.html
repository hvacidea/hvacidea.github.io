<p>The majority of central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system.

When the ac system works however your home doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
