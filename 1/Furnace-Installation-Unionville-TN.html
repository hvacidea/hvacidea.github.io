<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
