<h3>AC And Heating Repair in Jonesboro GA</h3>
<p>As kept in mind, inappropriate temperature level and humidity levels, and too little or too much air flow might likewise contribute to employee health complaints. Temperature level levels must range from 68 degrees - 75 degrees Fahrenheit and humidity levels between 30% and 60%. In addition, drafts triggered by excessive air circulation need to be avoided. Maintenance of proper temperature levels and humidity levels and proper air circulation will help to minimize the occurrence of upper breathing symptoms, and, possibly, skin rashes.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance products that just a trained HVAC technician will be able to do.

While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still essential to have a specialist technician inspect the system periodically.<p>
