<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the heat naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area.

When the furnace kicks in and that sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to save energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperature levels (style levels), rather of the greater temperature levels often used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require more cooling to offer thermal convenience inside your home.

<p>Ventilation: Reducing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outdoor) air to dilute polluted (indoor) air. Local building regulations likely define the quantity (and sometimes quality) of outside air that should be continually provided in your structures, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Momentarily increasing ventilation coupled with correct use of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for example, can be beneficial in diluting the concentration of noxious fumes in the air.<p>
