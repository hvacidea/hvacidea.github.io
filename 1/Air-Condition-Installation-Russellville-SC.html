<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
