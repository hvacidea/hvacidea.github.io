<p>All heating systems have some level of air filtration. From the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air cleansers, all require some standard maintenance.

<p>Through normal use and the system's presence outside, the coils and fins of the ac system may end up being very dirty. These elements of the equipment are crucial for effective air conditioning.

Often there is a musty smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can flourish in surprise or seldom accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products including carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be discovered, possibilities exist will be mold growing nearby. Repair the moisture problem, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely clean the location using established health department recommendations.<p>
