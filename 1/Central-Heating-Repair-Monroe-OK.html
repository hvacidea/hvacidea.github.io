<p>Indoor air pollution is caused by burning solid fuel sources - such as fire wood, crop waste, and dung - for cooking and heating. The task of an HVAC technician is relatively complicated and can vary significantly from one home or office to the next. Every maintenance job and repair is different from the last. Every maintenance job might need completely different steps and processes than the previous, depending on the age and condition of the system being examined. Setups can also differ considerably, depending upon the age of the structure and how well the existing system was installed. Sometimes, totally brand-new ductwork may require to be set up in a structure that had none before.<p>
<p>The life expectancy of a central air system is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's air conditioning system are more energy efficient than models made 5 years earlier, so it makes financial sense to replace or update your system if it's five years of ages or older. The very best central air conditioner you can buy today will use 30-50% less energy than one bought in 1975 while providing the same quantity of cooling.<p>
