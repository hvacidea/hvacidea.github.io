<p>When our furnace was dying, we got in touch with 2 local companies for quotes. While both were handy and useful, Ballard Natural Gas offered us a better offer, for extraordinary service. Instead of a basic sales job, the owner of the company made a full assessment of our heating unit and situated methods we might have more even heat.
