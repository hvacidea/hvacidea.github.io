<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
