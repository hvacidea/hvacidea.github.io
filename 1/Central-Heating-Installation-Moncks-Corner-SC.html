<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the same.

Do not put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to appropriately cure and solidify-- typically 2 to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom floor.<p>
