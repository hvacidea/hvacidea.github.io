<h3>Benefits of Investing on Gas Furnaces at Altoona FL</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy performance. Sometimes, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend used in autos in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be bought and used by licensed HVAC professionals. For systems requiring just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by lots of people.<p>
