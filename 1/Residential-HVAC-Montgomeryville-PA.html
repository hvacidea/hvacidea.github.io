<p>A specific air conditioning system that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It also utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic air conditioner because both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the very same air path. Because its condenser coil launches heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. Nevertheless, considering that all elements of the dehumidifier remain in the same space, no heat is gotten rid of. Rather, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier remains in the space as heat, so the space is actually heated up, simply as by an electric heating unit that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
