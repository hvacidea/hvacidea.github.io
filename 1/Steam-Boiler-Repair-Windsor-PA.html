<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical product over time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding.
