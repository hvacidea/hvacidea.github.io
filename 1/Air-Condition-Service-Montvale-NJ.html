<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance products that only a trained HVAC technician will be able to do.

<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They offer me top priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase extended guarantees or service contracts on anything however HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
