<p>The quality of the air inside our offices, houses and schools matters, especially considering that we invest the majority of our lives inside. Air conditioning system assist to dehumidify the inbound air, however in very damp environments or in cases where the a/c unit is extra-large, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned home will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and because the air conditioning unit will require more energy to cool your house. A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipe, which can be included as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump appears like a big central air conditioner system that sits outside your home. Heat pumps operate on electricity and work like a/c in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This allows them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heating unit (like a space heating system) with the same amount of electrical power. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
