<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts years, considering that it is secured indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical guidelines get rid of the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some poorly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot gradually, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature gradient to operate.<p>
