<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He devoted to the task based just on e-mails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the couple of affordable ones got. Others were nearly two times the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex properly advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The set up group was respectful of my house and installed the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post install examination outcomes look very good for braising and pipes quality. New system cools better than the 13 year old 4 heap R22 system it changed (also Provider).<p>
<p>Installation involves digging deep holes or long trenches to set up the pipes, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. However, you'll save cash over the long term because of the lower energy costs. Also, a geothermal system tends to last about two times as long as conventional air-source units. The absence of moving parts means you're less likely to spend huge on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be expected to last for 50 years. They're considerably more effective then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>
