If your HVAC unit is not draining properly, you'll have a water leakage. A constraint in your drain pipelines triggers a water leakage. There are many different locations an obstruction can occur. Among the main locations where obstructions start to establish is inside your evaporator HVAC coil.<p>
<p>Clogged seamless gutters can lead to water leaking into your house, causing mold growth, according to the EPA.
