The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system may be most inexpensive. Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

Likewise, clean ducts and correct airflow are important to a well-functioning system, however property owners do not have the necessary devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still required to have a professional technician examine the system occasionally.<p>

<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They offer me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
