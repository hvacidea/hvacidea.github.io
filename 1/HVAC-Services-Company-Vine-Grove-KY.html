<p>While radon in water is not a problem in homes served by the majority of public water products, it has been found in well water. If you've checked the air in your home and discovered a radon issue, and you have a well, get in touch with a laboratory certified to determine radiation in water to have your water tested. Radon problems in water can be easily fixed. Call your state radon workplace or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to find out more.<p>
<p>Indoor air contamination originates from a range of sources; the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has actually determined building products, home furnishings, and mold as major concerns, but much of the risk also originates from burning things. For example, cigarette smoking or burning wood for heating or cooking can develop pollution in homes that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is a particularly huge concern in the establishing world.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce toxins.) Nevertheless, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the quantity of outside air penetrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
