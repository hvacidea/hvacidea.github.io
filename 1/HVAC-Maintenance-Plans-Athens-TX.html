<p>The federal government suggests that homes be weatherized in order to lower the amount of energy needed for cooling and heating. While weatherization is underway, however, steps need to also be taken to decrease contamination from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in your house" for suggested actions.) In addition, homeowners need to be alert to the introduction of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth. Extra weatherization procedures should not be undertaken up until these issues have actually been fixed.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and causes shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also evidence from animal research studies that duplicated exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular danger from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
