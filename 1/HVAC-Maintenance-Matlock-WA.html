Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive flexible hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
