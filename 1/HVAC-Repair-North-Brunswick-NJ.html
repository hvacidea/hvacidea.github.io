<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the average home. In very dry climates, evaporative coolers, sometimes referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather.

The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the incoming air is minimized, but it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the sensible heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather substantial.<p>
