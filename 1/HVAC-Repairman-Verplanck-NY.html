As an initial step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the firm to set more powerful indoor guidelines based on the most current science for NO2.

<p>There are a couple of possibilities to describe short cycling in really cold weather. The most obvious is the possibility of the high needs placed on the system due to the extremely low temperatures. Sometimes, the furnace will just run harder to preserve a warm environment for your house when the weather is very cold. There are other possibilities such as a fracture in the heat exchanger or a damaged thermostat. Contact among our specialists if you need clarity on this problem.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your home that perfect temperature all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those common air contaminants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their task. Not only does that cause problem for your indoor air quality, it also wears down your AC system, which can lead to costly repairs down the roadway. So, be sure to change your AC filters routinely, or get an air conditioning service plan which usually consists of a filter change - particularly if you are allergy-prone or live in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
