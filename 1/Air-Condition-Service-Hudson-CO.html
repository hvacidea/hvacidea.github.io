I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with different rates and different problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the 6th person, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. Another event when the AC quit working at my rental house. He helped me difficulty shoot the problem when I called and he advised me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working once again. He is truthful, trusted, and affordable on rate. It's tough to find a truthful AC guy and I'm grateful I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>

I appreciate the sincerity. Stability isn't simply their name, it's a company design they take seriously. You people are officially on speed dial. Talk with you soon.<p>
