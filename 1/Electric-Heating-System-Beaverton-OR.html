<p>We tend to think of air contamination as something outdoors - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer. Connection problems along the line that supplies power to your furnace can jeopardize the efficiency of the system. Loose, defective or missing wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and interrupt service. Part of preserving your furnace involves examining the recommended connections as well as temperature level and pressure assesses. Take time to check these parts for dust and damage, making sure that they are tight and secure.<p>

<p>Some health results might appear shortly after a single exposure or repeated direct exposures to a contaminant.

In some cases the treatment is simply removing the person's exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be recognized. Right after direct exposure to some indoor air contaminants, signs of some illness such as asthma may appear, be aggravated or worsened.<p>
