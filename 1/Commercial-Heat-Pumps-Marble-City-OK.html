<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the typical house. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the inbound air is minimized, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be rather considerable if the entering air is dry enough.<p>

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
