<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the standard hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the traditional water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut off entirely.<p>

The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the cooling individually for each space.
