The choice of indoor systems has one limitation: their overall power ought to not surpass the capability of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units higher than the outdoor capability by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to expect better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the very same time, since the total capacity of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outdoor system. Put simply, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all operating indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms may not have a very comfy temperature level.
