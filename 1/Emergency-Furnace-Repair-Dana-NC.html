<p>An undersize unit won't have the ability to cool rooms down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to run since it needs to run longer than a correctly sized system. Since it merely takes more electrical energy to run a larger system, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has an opportunity to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential moisture. The result is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In reality, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>
