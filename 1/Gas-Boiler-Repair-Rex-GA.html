<p>If your a/c is more than 8 years of ages, repair is most likely not worth the expenditure, unless it's a simple issue like debris obstructing the condenser system or a used fan belt. Still, to best weigh your repair-or-replace choice, ask your contractor to examine not simply the condition of your existing equipment, but also the ducts that provide the cool air and the overall quality of the insulation in your home.

My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on price for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
