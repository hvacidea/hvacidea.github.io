<h3>Heating Service in Reston Virginia</h3>
<p>Fortunately, you do not need to go through this process alone. G & S Heating Cooling & Electric uses just the most professional HVAC service technicians, with years of experience in AC installation. No matter what your unique scenario is, we can discover an air conditioning system that will fulfill your requirements. As soon as you choose a suitable AC system, we can set up the whole thing for you, start to finish. By trusting us with your AC installation, you can rest assured that it will be done securely and expertly.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply eight to 10 years old, it could flatter two times the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would use. That's because it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to offer a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling costs than devices installed simply a couple of years back.<p>
<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning system works but the house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and knowledgeable.
