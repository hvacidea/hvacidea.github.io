<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you should check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
