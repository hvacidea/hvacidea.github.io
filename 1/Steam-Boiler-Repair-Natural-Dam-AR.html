<p>Radiant heating uses a number of special advantages over forced air heater. For instance, radiant heat systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems. They don't need to stress over duct leaks, which are responsible for output losses of as much as 30% in other heater types. Transmitting heat through strong things will also trigger it to last longer than using air as a thermal medium. A home heated up by a glowing system will heat up quicker, and remain warm with less energy spent. These are simply a few of the many benefits that a radiant heat system can use you.<p>
