<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Since many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
