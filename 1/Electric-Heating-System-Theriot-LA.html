<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable finishing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the very same. As soon as the wiring is complete, energize the system for a couple of minutes to ensure the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Don't put the system into complete operation until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively treat and solidify-- typically two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
