Installations can likewise differ substantially, depending on the age of the structure and how well the existing system was installed. In some cases, completely new ductwork might need to be set up in a structure that had none before.<p>
<p>There are numerous actions a house owner can take to choose products that will avoid indoor air problems from happening - a number of them are mentioned here.

Secondly, if you prepare to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, particularly concrete in basements, ensure that a reliable wetness barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet. Do temporarily adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be eliminated if it ends up being damp.<p>
