<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off contaminants.)

Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system must momentarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
