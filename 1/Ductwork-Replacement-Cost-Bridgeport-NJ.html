<p>The function of many building ventilation systems is to generate adequate fresh air for resident convenience while controlling temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and developing security at reasonable energy costs.

<p>The first air conditioners and fridges employed flammable or harmful gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that could result in fatal mishaps when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. produced the very first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number suggesting the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and building comfort cooling is an HCFC called chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning unit (PTAC) systems are likewise called wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently utilized in hotels, have two separate systems (terminal bundles), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This lessens the interior system footprint and allows each room to be changed independently. PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the a/c unit into a heat pump While room cooling supplies optimum flexibility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is generally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
