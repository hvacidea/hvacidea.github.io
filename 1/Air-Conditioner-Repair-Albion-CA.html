<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Albion CA</h3>
<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can trigger watery eyes, burning feelings in the eyes and throat, queasiness, and trouble in breathing in some human beings exposed at raised levels (above 0.1 parts per million).

It has likewise been shown to trigger cancer in animals and may cause cancer in humans.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
