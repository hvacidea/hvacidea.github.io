<p>We're Not Simply Another Air Duct Cleaning and HVAC Service Company. Another thing to watch out for is the dust that collects during summer seasons. The best thing to do is making certain that the heating system burners are checked and cleaned up completely prior to cooler seasons start. Constantly be sure that the furnace is cleaned up yearly to avoid soot and condensation which causes burners to quit working correctly. Perhaps it is time to start thinking about buying a brand-new one if your furnace is in a really poor condition.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not just was the price excellent however Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
