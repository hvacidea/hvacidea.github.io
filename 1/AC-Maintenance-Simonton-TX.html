<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

By choosing a central AC unit that has as high of an efficiency rating as possible, you can decrease your carbon footprint and save money in the long run. Efficiency ratings ought to be labeled with all units. While efficient units may cost more, choosing an Energy Star-rated home appliance is a fantastic way to enjoy extra comfort.<p>
