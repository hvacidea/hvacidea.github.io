Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
