Others were nearly two times the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex properly recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install group was respectful of my home and set up the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post install examination results look very good for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools far better than the 13 year old 4 heap R22 system it replaced (likewise Provider).<p>
