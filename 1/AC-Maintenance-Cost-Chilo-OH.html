<p>A/c unit can develop a great deal of water because they remove moisture from the air. To eliminate this, they have a normally plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. With time, algae can obstruct this pipeline and, when it does, the AC will not work. In truth, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the location. To handle condensate problems, please see Air conditioning system Leaks Water, below.<p>

<p>The exhaust outlets allow all harmful gases to escape your residential or commercial property so there's no dangerous accumulation of carbon monoxide gas and other such gases. They can lead to an unsafe build-up and jeopardize your security if the exhaust outlets are blocked.

They will try to find indications of corrosion, leaks, and back draft and repair the issue during their maintenance runs.<p>
<p>The installation was quick, professional and effectively done. The installers were respectful and understood exactly what to do. I am an engineer by occupation and recognize easily people who are proficient at what they do.

Thank you to them as they definitely deserve my thanks and gratitude for a job well done.<p>
<p>There is no simple response, but numerous use the rule of thumb that if a repair adds up to around 50% of the cost of a new furnace, replacing is probably a better solution. If the current system has not sustained other significant repairs, is in otherwise outstanding condition, and problems that caused the breakdown can be recognized and fixed, repairing the unit can make a great deal of sense too.<p>
