<p>A specific air conditioning unit that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic a/c unit because both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the exact same air path.

However, given that all components of the dehumidifier are in the same room, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the space as heat, so the room is really warmed, just as by an electric heating unit that draws the very same amount of power.<p>
