<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems in Charleston Afb SC - The Benefits</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was fantastic and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his inspection, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>

<h3>AC Unit Repair in Charleston Afb SC</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
