<p>When setting up over concrete pieces, we advise using our insulation boards. When used in conjunction with underfloor heating by acting as an extremely effective thermal barrier, Warmup Insulation Boards will save you cash. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of permitting heat to warm up the concrete slab below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will find that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>
