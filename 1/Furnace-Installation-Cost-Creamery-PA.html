<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the water pipe getting in and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summertime when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional water heater can be turned off completely.<p>
<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit airflow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your home will not warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running however no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
