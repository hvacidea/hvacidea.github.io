<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat rises, so it makes good sense to find the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area. All objects in the hot zone reach stability in temperature level after the convected heat system has been operating for a while, including individuals. When the furnace kicks in and that abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>

<p>Fact: Geothermal systems really consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is returned to that same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceedingly rare now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually get rid of countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in traditional systems.<p>
<p>To be honest, few of the facilities supervisors who use our indoor air quality monitoring service pertained to us because of that. Generally they were at first interested in remotely monitoring some other aspect of their buildings, such as energy usage, in an effort to cut costs. It wasn't until later on, as they continued dealing with us, that they learnt more about and carried out indoor air quality keeping track of to offer a healthier, safer building environment-- and to head off the unfavorable effects related to indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
