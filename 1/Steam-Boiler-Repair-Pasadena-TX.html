<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, however furnace technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a big central air conditioner unit that sits outdoors your house. Heat pumps work on electrical power and work like a/c unit in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air. This allows them to produce two to three times as much heat as a basic electric heating unit (like a space heating system) with the exact same quantity of electrical power. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
