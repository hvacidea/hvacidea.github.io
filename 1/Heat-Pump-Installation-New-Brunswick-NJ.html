<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is ESSENTIAL to protect the efficiency and performance of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. Nevertheless, select your contractor wisely, a number of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales tactics that DO make the most of uninformed property owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a trusted company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable score are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Cooling contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
