<p>Chemical contaminants: Unpredictable natural compounds ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are various, differed, and ubiquitous. They consist of both human-made and naturally occurring chemical compounds. Chemical pollutants can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from products utilized in the structure (e.g., workplace devices; furniture, wall and flooring coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer items) unintentional spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>

Dust and dander are infamous for decreasing the air quality in your house, but there are many other pollutants that can not only dirty up the air, but cause other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and building materials contribute to bad air quality, and can also cause cancers.

Ventilation system filters that are not replaced on a regular basis may end up being clogged up, reducing air circulation volume, distribution, and quality.
