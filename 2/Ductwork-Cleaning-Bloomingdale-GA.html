<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in lots. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 lot system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it indicates the quantity of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Ask about training and certifications. A good place to begin is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) accreditation.
