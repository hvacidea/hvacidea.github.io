<p>Packaged terminal air conditioner (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly utilized in hotels, have 2 different units (terminal plans), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This minimizes the interior system footprint and enables each room to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to offer heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, transforming the a/c unit into a heat pump While room a/c supplies optimum flexibility, when utilized to cool numerous rooms at a time it is usually more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
