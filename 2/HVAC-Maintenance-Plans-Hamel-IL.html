<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>

Replacing them to repair the air conditioning might be a lot more economical when the issue is reasonably small.<p>
