<p>Central air systems are measured in heaps. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it suggests the quantity of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>

<p>The main factor property owners do not purchase an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 per year, depending upon the amount of services provided. If the system is brand-new and still under a maker's warranty, the cost might not be beneficial. Any major repairs must be covered under the maker's guarantee. Nevertheless, some makers need regular maintenance as a term of the warranty.<p>
<p>Depending on where in the United States your house lies, the local region's environment can change considerably.
