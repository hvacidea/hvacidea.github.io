<h3>Heat Pump Replacement in Pacific Palisades CA</h3>
<p>I have actually been utilizing them for several years for my companies, my own homes and my property customers' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with different costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me thoroughly the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. When I called and he recommended me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a cent to have the system working again, he helped me problem shoot the problem. He is truthful, trustworthy, and affordable on price. It's difficult to discover an honest AC man and I'm glad I found Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
