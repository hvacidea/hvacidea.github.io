Dust and dander are well-known for lowering the air quality in your house, however there are lots of other contaminants that can not just dirty up the air, but cause other health complications. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning products and building products contribute to poor air quality, and can likewise cause cancers.

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
