<p>Resideo offers a variety of energy-efficient Whole-House Ventilation System solutions for both new construction and retrofit applications. Breathing air contaminants can lead to asthmatic and allergic responses, infections and other health issue that involve the lungs, nose and throat. For example, animal cats, caged birds and rodents, and canines can produce dander and other particles that can set off allergic reactions or asthma signs in some people. Secondhand smoke is also harmful to individuals, especially kids.<p>
<p>For example, problems occur when, in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to generate sufficient quantities of outdoor air. Insufficient ventilation also occurs if the air supply and return vents within each room are blocked or put in such a way that outside air does not in fact reach the breathing zone of structure occupants. Poorly located outdoor air consumption vents can also bring in air infected with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from restrooms. Lastly, ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by spreading out biological pollutants that have multiplied in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, a/c, or the inside surfaces of ventilation duct work.<p>
