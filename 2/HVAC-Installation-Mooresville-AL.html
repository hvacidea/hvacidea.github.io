<p>Another method to reducing the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your house is to increase the quantity of outside air coming inside. Most home heating and cooling systems, consisting of required air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window air conditioning unit with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or cooking area fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of pollutants straight from the space where the fan is located and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly carried out in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
