<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.

To avoid this from taking place, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs managed by professionals, go to Acme Vehicle Electric & Repair today.<p>
