<p>If you think a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a moldy smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>In an area where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make great main heating unit. You'll wish to have a backup system set up, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperatures reach freezing. Your heating technician can set up controls which immediately closed down the heatpump if temperatures drop and reach listed below freezing. The controls will call for the furnace to come on, efficiently heating the house in these conditions.<p>
