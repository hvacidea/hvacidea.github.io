Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and preserve. Leaking return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Once again, if you presume a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>

The controls will call for the furnace to come on, efficiently heating the house in these conditions.<p>
