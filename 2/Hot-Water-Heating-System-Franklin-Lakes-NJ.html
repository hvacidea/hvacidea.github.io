<h3>Heating Installation in Franklin Lakes New Jersey</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, however to have two major components fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the invoice prior to work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

Now the "hard part" once a year shut off the electrical power open the furnace and very thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power.
