<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been revealed to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not get rid of as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do not accept them up until they have been correctly dried. Attempt a different dry cleaner if items with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
