<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives ask for assessment and support in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. However, a lot of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The mix most used in direct-expansion house and building convenience cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>
