<h3>How To Pick An HVAC Company at York SC</h3>
<p>I admit I have not done the math lately, however I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to routine examinations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits. I seem like they offer me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little more for that peace of mind.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
