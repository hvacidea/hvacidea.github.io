<p>UW students, visitors and workers should have a clean, healthy environment in which to work, study and perform different activities. If the air quality is poor it can affect an individual's performance, convenience, and health.  The function of the Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) program is to supply and preserve comfortable and healthy environments devoid of contaminants. An essential part of the program is responding to and fixing concerns of structure occupants about issues in their work environment.<p>
<p>Advanced ventilation systems that allow higher air flow from the outdoors, air quality monitoring platforms and sensing units, and brand-new air purification innovations are becoming more common as readily available options in commercial and residential HVAC item packages. Adoption of these technologies, however, has actually not been widespread, as customers remain mostly oblivious to the impacts of air quality on health and efficiency.<p>
<p>People working in structures with poor IAQ may observe unpleasant or moldy smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have signs that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all exposures cause symptoms, so there is no replacement for good structure management.<p>
