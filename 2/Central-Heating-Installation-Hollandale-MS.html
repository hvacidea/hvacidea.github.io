<p>Expert heater setups. However, even the best-maintained heating unit will ultimately fail. HVAC professionals advise following this basic guideline when choosing whether it deserves buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a brand-new system, it's finest to purchase brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be using more energy than required.<p>
<p>A SEER ranking means Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER score of a system is the cooling output at varying temperatures during the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input during the very same duration.
