<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>

We understand about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air pollutants are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can go beyond 100 times that of outside levels of the very same pollutants.

Geothermal HVAC systems begin at about $5,000 per lot, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per load. However, brand-new installation practices are reducing expenses, to the point where the price is getting closer to standard systems under the right conditions.<p>

Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to set up an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>. Prior to choosing the installation place of air conditioning system, several main factors require to be considered.

The outside system needs to likewise be found in an open space, otherwise the heat from the house will not be efficiently discharged outdoors and the performance of the entire system will drop greatly.
