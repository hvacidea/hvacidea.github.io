The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, however it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the reasonable heat of the entering air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite significant.<p>
