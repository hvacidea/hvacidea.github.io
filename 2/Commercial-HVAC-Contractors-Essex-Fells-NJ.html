<p>SysTech Design specializes in commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
