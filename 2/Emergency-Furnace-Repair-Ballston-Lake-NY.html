<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise apartment or condos bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has actually viewed the single-family home installation business entirely flip on its head the last couple of years. Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to up to three months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not simply with beginners more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle property owners are finally giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
