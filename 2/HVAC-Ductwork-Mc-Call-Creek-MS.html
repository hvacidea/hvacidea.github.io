<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor workplace, class or laboratory environments, instead of industrial or outdoor settings. In tasks where union membership is not a concern, an HVAC technician might finish the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and mounting the ductwork in the building. It might also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork links to private areas.<p>
<p>Because it's the most typical heating system in Seattle houses, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your home through ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas heating systems are rated for performance. Older units from the 1970s might be ranked 65%, suggesting 35% of the heating energy is lost throughout the combustion process. Today's designs range from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a brand-new, effective gas furnace is a fairly uncomplicated process. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be quite expensive if you are including on to your home or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
