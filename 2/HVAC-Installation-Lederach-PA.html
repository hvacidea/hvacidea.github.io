<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Simply today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He knew simply what the issue was and repaired it extremely rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
