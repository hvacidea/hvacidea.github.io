<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for air conditioner repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you must inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
