<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be delightful, and were really delighted that someone as skilled as Adam was able to return and repair the air conditioner. We had actually purchased the club member maintenance strategy, which assisted offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to test the a/c prior to you purchase. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to check AC systems even in winter. We wish we had actually known him then.<p>

<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby declining its efficiency.<p>
