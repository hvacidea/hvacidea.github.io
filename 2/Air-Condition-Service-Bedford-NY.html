<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the water pipe entering and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the standard water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe going into and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the conventional water heater can be shut down completely.<p>

Filthy filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more extreme cases trigger the system to shut down entirely. By contrast, checking and changing a furnace filter can generally be done in simply a couple of minutes, typically with no tools needed. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
