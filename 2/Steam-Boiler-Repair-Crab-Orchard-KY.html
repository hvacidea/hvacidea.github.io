<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>

The main route of direct exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, many commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from inadequately positioned or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which typically release water in an aerosol which might get in neighboring ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical facilities and retirement home, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most commonly reported cases of Legionellosis.
