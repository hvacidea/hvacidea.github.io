<p>Lead has long been recognized as a hazardous toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " primary ecological hazard to the health of kids in the United States." There are lots of methods which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, infected soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead goes into the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has actually settled. Before it was known how harmful lead might be, it was used in paint, gasoline, pipes, and lots of other products.<p>

<p>Unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary factors to bad indoor air quality; they are common both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from products or processes; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly harmless as a new carpet is most likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water use.<p>
