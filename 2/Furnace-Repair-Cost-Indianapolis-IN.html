Heaters that kick on often may be due to a filthy filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal workings, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or perhaps an unclean burner.<p>

No extra charge.<p>
