<h3>Things to Consider When Buying a Heat Pump in Ledgewood NJ</h3>
<p>Sean was very practical. He is a really pleasant person to deal with. No pressure applied to buy additional stuff. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make certain they were no problems aside from the blower motor. The only reason he might not install the new blower motor was due to the fact that there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't use them.  Secondly like extended vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to correctly service and the unit has actually been running problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
