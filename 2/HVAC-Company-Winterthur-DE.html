<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, homes and workplaces matters, especially because we spend most of our lives inside. Air conditioning system help to dehumidify the incoming air, but in very damp climates or in cases where the a/c unit is extra-large, it may not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the a/c unit will require more energy to cool your home. A preferable option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be included as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
