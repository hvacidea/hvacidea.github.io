A coolant flush is standard maintenance for your vehicle's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or go to Acme Auto Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill requirements.<p>
<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your house that best temperature level throughout the year. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're removing a few of those common air contaminants. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job.

So, make sure to alter your AC filters frequently, or get a cooling service plan which typically includes a filter modification - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
