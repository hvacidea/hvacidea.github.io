<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives ask for assessment and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies.

However, a number of these houses were found to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product.
