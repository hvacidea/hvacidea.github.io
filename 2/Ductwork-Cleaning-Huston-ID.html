The selection of indoor units has one restriction: their total power needs to not surpass the capability of the outside system. In practice, nevertheless, it is really common to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units greater than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is incorrect to anticipate much better efficiency when all indoor units are turned on at the exact same time, given that the total capacity of the entire system is restricted by the capacity of the outdoor unit.
