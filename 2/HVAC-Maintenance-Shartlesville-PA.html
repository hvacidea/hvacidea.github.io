<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our expert cleaning and sanitizing services are categorized as an Essential Business in Los Angeles. Today's heating systems are rated 90% effectiveness or much better; it is not uncommon for a modern-day furnace to be rated 94 or 95% effective. Compared to older designs, which may be ranked as low as 80% effectiveness, this can imply considerable savings in annual heating expenses. Modern two- and three-stage heating systems increase effectiveness even further by running at lower or higher capability depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>Apartment or condos can have the exact same indoor air issues as single-family homes due to the fact that many of the pollution sources, such as the interior structure products, furnishings, and family products, are similar.

<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact take in no water. All the water is returned to that same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that squandered the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are extremely unusual now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually eliminate millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>

<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, suggesting they utilize air to exchange heat, in the very same way as a vehicle radiator or typical home a/c does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It collects water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled location; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outside air.<p>
