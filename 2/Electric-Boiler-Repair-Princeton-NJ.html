<p>Info provided in this security guide is based on current clinical and technical understanding of the issues provided and is reflective of the jurisdictional borders established by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. The requirements do not need you to change your existing central air units, and replacement parts and services should still be offered for your home's systems. The "life-span" of a central air conditioner is about 15 to twenty years. Manufacturers usually continue to support existing devices by making replacement parts offered and honoring maintenance agreements after the new standard goes into impact.<p>

<p>Some biological pollutants trigger allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity pneumonitis, hay fever, and some kinds of asthma. Transmittable diseases, such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transferred through the air. Molds and mildews release disease-causing toxic substances. Symptoms of health problems caused by biological pollutants include sneezing, watery eyes, coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, sleepiness, fever, and digestive problems.<p>
<p>Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main cause of indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in enough outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
