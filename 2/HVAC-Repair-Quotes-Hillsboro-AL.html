<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control may conflict with efforts to try to optimize the operation to save energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperatures (design levels), rather of the greater temperature levels in some cases utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for the majority of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need additional cooling to offer thermal comfort indoors. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors creates the requirement for mindful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities give rise to mold growth and wetness indoors is related to a higher frequency of resident respiratory problems.<p>
<p>It is not advised that "routine" occupational direct exposure limits (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be utilized to determine if the general indoor air quality meets a specific standard.
