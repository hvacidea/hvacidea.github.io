A trained technician must fix any leak, test the repair, and then charge the system with the right quantity of refrigerant. Keep in mind that the efficiency and efficiency of your ac system is biggest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the manufacturer's specification, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leakages can likewise be hazardous to the environment.<p>

Heat output is determined in British Thermal Systems, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace ought to be matched to the size of the house.
