<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply eight to ten years old, it might suck up to two times the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would use. That's due to the fact that it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to provide a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER.

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product over time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
