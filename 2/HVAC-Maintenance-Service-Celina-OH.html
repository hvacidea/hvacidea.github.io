<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & experienced throughout the check out. They suggested replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap however a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I happily had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was defective. No charge for the go to or the new part.

<h3>Designing Tips to Central Heating Systems at Celina OH</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really delighted that someone as experienced as Adam was able to fix the air and return conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance plan, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our tip to any homebuyers: work with Blue Flame to evaluate the a/c unit before you buy. We bought this house in February, so it was too cold to switch on the AC then, however Adam said he had methods to test AC units even in winter. We wish we had known him then.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a pipe twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the consumption vent in your house. Now the "tough part" once a year turned off the electrical energy open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
