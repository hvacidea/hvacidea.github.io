<p>Your ventilation, heating, and air conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a variety of pollutants that have the prospective to adversely impact your health-- impurities such as mold, fungi, bacteria, and really little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor ought to evaluate and, if necessary, upgrade the structure envelope. For example, he may seal gaps and cracks in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling costs.
