<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current research studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in houses where dry-cleaned products are saved and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pushing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent.
