<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most economical if your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape. Using existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to install a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
