<p>I am really amazed with this company. One of my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the issue within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call organisation several years ago and know the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everyone. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>The primary health impact related to exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your threat of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
