He dedicated to the job based just on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was among the few reasonable ones received. Others were nearly twice the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install group was considerate of my house and set up the devices in the expected amount of time. post install examination results look very good for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 year old 4 load R22 unit it changed (likewise Provider).<p>
<p>AC air handler screeching or grinding noises. Though many air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older systems may be belt-driven.
