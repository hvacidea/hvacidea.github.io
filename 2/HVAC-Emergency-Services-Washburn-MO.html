<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Filthy filters are the most typical cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your house won't heat up.

An unclean filter likewise triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
