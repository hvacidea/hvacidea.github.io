<p>Expert heating unit installations. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heating unit will ultimately fail. HVAC professionals advise following this basic rule when choosing whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a new system, it's finest to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than required.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to complete. I 'd evaluated brand-new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost great but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more enhanced. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
