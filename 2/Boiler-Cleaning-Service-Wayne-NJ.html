<p>I am extremely pleased with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business many years ago and know the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also pleased that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be using Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the idea of an in-floor heating system appears less like a high-end item and more like a requirement. (Besides, heated up floors were good enough for the Roman Empire) But prior to you dedicate to what can be a major renovation job, it's best to ask yourself whether a radiant floor heater is an appropriate solution for your specific home heating requirements.<p>
