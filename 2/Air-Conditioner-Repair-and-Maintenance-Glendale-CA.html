Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy costs; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. In addition, extremely dirty or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
