<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, but furnace technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also.

<h3>Advantages of Investing on Gas Furnaces in Rochester WA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' trigger a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>When all the jobs have been completed, the last job is to test the system to make sure it cools efficiently. HVAC systems are run through the thermostat. This last check might point out faults in the thermostat, which might be as basic as a requirement to change batteries. A failure to turn on might just include a tripped circuit breaker. At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician goes over any issues or issues and makes suggestions about upgrades where appropriate.<p>
