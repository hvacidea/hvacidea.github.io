<p>Current Review: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and polite. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>

Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
