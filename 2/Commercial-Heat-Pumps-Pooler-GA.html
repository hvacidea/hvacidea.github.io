And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts revealed and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature level, and the unit does not fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
