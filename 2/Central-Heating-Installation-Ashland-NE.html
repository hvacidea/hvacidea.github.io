<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can break and are at the top of the list of common a/c service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every five years or so. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Image 6).<p>
