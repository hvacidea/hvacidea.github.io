A lot of house heating and cooling systems, including forced air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window air conditioner with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate.

An expert maintenance technician will clean the condensate and flush drain to ensure all excess wetness streams far from the system.<p>
