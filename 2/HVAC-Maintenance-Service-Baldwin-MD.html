<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
