<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace in Sunol CA?</h3>

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you may think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
