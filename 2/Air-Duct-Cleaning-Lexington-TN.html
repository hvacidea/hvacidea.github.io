<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Service in Lexington</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, classroom or lab environments, instead of industrial or outside settings. In tasks where union subscription is not an issue, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This includes cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC unit, and mounting the ductwork in the structure. It may also consist of the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to specific spaces.<p>

As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, generally mounted on the side of the furnace.<p>
