<p>Proper ventilation helps enhance indoor air quality. Goettl is a growing HVAC contractor with an older name. The firm began in Phoenix in 1939 and produced air conditioners for high-temperature customers for years, up until the required for high-efficiency units required Goettl to end production.

The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less frequently you'll need to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 homes with just one cooling filter require replacing more often.<p>

<p>Though it may be hard to believe, the air inside your house can be even worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are infamous for reducing the air quality in your home, but there are numerous other toxins that can not just unclean up the air, but result in other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and building products add to poor air quality, and can likewise cause cancers.

<p>The primary health impact associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture risks, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
