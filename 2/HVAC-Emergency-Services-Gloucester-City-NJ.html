<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to vaporize, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it takes in heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is taken in from inside your home and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system should temporarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered only in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
