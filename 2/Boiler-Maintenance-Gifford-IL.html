PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two separate units (terminal plans), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each space to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems might be adapted to supply heating in winter, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c into a heat pump While room a/c supplies optimum flexibility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is typically more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
