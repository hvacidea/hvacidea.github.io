<p>Due to the current Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The capability to cool and heat your home at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is presently and the size of your house.

Also a house with energy efficient windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will need far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfy. Other factors that can impact this might be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roofing, attics, basements, floor covering, and more.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outdoor unit as near your house as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on rate for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
