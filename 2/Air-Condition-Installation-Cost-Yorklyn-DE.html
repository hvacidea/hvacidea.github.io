PTAC systems might be adapted to supply heating in cold weather, either straight by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the ac system into a heatpump While space cooling offers maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool many spaces at a time it is usually more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
