<h3>Determining Heat Pump Efficiency in Del Valle TX</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The team took the whole day as they required to get rid of the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high performance heater. We selected getting something more expensive than a conventional hot water heater as gas is one of our biggest utility expenditures. We feel that this brand-new system will last a very long time and usage very little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
