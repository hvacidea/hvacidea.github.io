<p>Sean was really handy. He is an extremely enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure applied to buy additional stuff. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no problems aside from the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will inform you clean up the filters, take a hose twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet.

Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electricity open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet returned on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
