<p>If you need furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating, you are a covidiot. Our furnace went down with a damaged igniter, and nobody else could come other than for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, but they had to buy it. My wife stated that she had seen an excellent review for James, so I called. He can be found in a few hours (weaving a mask) and described the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most good people I have satisfied in a long time. If we want to have options to ACME heating, we need to support the genuine people who are there for us. Please do.<p>
