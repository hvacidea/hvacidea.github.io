<h3>Air Conditioner Parts in New Ipswich New Hampshire</h3>
<p>New air conditioners usually vary from 13 SEER to 23 SEER. A higher SEER score suggests higher energy performance and possibly lower energy bills.

<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Simply this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the same day.
