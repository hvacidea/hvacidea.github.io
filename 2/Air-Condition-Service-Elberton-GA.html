<p>Lead has long been acknowledged as a harmful toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services called lead the " primary environmental risk to the health of kids in the United States." There are many methods which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, weakening paint, and dust. Airborne lead enters the body when an individual breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Prior to it was understood how damaging lead might be, it was used in paint, gasoline, water pipes, and lots of other items.<p>

<p>Filters can get filthy quickly, especially if you live in a location that can be dirty. The HVAC system filters trap all sort of dust, particles, germs, and clean the air. They are accountable for keeping the indoor air quality. Your HVAC system will ultimately stop performing as you expect it to if they're not cleaned up and changed frequently. The cooling and heating will mishandle and the indoor air quality will aggravate. Checking and changing the air filters is among the most essential aspects of HVAC maintenance.<p>

The technician who discussed our choices did an excellent job in ensuring we understood the benefits and drawbacks of each option. The technicians who set up the brand-new system were professional and fast, while taking time to make certain we understood how the new system worked. In general a first rate experience.<p>
