<p>Fantastic Product! Delivery was sort of odd being that package was opened and items might have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The product was extremely lite weight and takes time to use. Keep in mind: purchase recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with assistance, we dealt with problems. I would recommend this item to anyone who's remodeling or installing their restroom for the very first time.
