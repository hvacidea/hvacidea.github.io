<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, understand that there are maintenance products that only an experienced HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can result in pricey compressor failure, however a house owner doesn't have the tools or skills necessary to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and correct airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, but house owners do not have the needed devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still essential to have a specialist technician check the system regularly.<p>

<p>A packaged system, typically set up on the roofing system, is most frequently used on commercial structures, however it is also an alternative for house owners to consider. Often times, these systems consist of not only the air conditioning system itself however also a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are great for those aiming to conserve cash on the installation of a brand-new heating and cooling system separately, given that the unit is combined. However, one con is that these systems are typically just available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be an excellent way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more pricey than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the best alternative for house owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller sized spending plans.<p>
