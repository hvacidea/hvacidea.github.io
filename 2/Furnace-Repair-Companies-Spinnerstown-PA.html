<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most common reason for furnace issues. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will get too hot and shut off too rapidly, and your house won't warm up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<h3>Picking the Ideal HVAC System For The Project in Spinnerstown PA</h3>
<p>Another approach to lowering the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your house is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming indoors. A lot of home heating and cooling systems, including required air heater, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window air conditioner with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or cooking area fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of impurities directly from the space where the fan lies and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
