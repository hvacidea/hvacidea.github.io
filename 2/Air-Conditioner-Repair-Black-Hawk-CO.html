<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, typically referred to as central air conditioning" or split-system cooling", flow cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the walls, floorings, or ceilings covered by grills) carry cooled air from the air conditioner to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it circulates through the home; then it flows back to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Discover how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
