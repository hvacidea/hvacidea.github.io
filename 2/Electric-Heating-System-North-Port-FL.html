<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these three things initially. Make certain all the registers in your house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). The decreased air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several registers were closed or the filter was clogged. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's good airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>

We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>
