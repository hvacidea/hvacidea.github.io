<h3>Choosing the Ideal Cleveland MO Business For Heating Repair</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his examination, guaranteeing I comprehended what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little high on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
