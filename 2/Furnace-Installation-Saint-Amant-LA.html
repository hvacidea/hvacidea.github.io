<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning in Saint Amant LA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature listed below the space temperature, and then switch it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioning system's compressor, wait at least five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You should hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
