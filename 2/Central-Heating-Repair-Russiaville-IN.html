<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
