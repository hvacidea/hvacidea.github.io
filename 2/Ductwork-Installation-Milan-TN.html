This is normally used in a second or third-floor  area and takes advantage of the flooring joist cavities while preventing the cost, weight and extra density of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber glowing flooring heat hydronic system efficient, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are installed under the pipes to direct heat upward.<p>
