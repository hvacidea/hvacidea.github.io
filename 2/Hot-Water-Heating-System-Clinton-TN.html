<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head unit that installs on a wall. Because approximately 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless unit has an integrated efficiency benefit. Because they don't need any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are great for additions. Due to the fact that an unit is set up in each room or area you want to heat, you can have higher control over the temperature of each zone, which can save energy.

In this case, the control system is extremely important to maintaining a correct temperature level.<p>
