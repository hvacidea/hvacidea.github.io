<p>This is particularly noteworthy, as gas stoves can trigger levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with improperly changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>3. Gas Furnaces While the cost of heating your home with a gas furnace is generally higher than many heatpump alternatives, they can still be extremely efficient, depending upon the model you purchase.

This means it can warm up your house to the preferred temperature quicker than a heatpump can.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners, frequently described as central air conditioning" or split-system a/c", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the floorings, walls, or ceilings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the ac system to the house. This cooled air becomes warmer as it circulates through the house; then it flows back to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Find out how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
