<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently described as merely glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating elements installed in the subfloor of each room in the house, occasionally linked to terminal units like baseboard heating units. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating elements, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heat.<p>
