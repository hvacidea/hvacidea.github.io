<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable with time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical product in time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complex systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
