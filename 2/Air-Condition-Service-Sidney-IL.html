Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Remove the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
