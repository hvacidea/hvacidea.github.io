<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>All houses need efficient ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has actually been burnt out from usage. Another possible factor could be a damaged thermostat, preventing the furnace from adjusting to the proper temperature level. Furnaces that kick on often might be due to a filthy filter, which is not allowing the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or perhaps an unclean burner.<p>
<p>If you work in building, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator repair shop or lead factory, or your hobby involves lead, you might unknowingly bring lead into your house on your hands or clothing.

Soil by highways and roads may be contaminated from years of exhaust fumes from cars and trucks and trucks that used leaded gas. Usage door mats to wipe your feet prior to entering the house. If you work with lead in your task or a pastime, change your clothes before you go home and clean these clothes independently. Motivate your children to play in sand and grassy areas instead of dirt which stays with toys and fingers.
