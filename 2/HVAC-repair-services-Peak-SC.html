<p>Particular immediate results resemble those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is typically hard to identify if the signs are a result of direct exposure to indoor air contamination. For this reason, it is necessary to take notice of the time and location the symptoms take place. If the signs fade or disappear when a person is away from the house and return when the individual returns, an effort should be made to identify indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some effects may be made worse by an inadequate supply of outdoor air or from the humidity, cooling, or heating conditions prevalent in the house.<p>
<p>Whatever heater you install, it's important that it's sized correctly for your home. Too big and you'll be paying more for devices and installation than you should. Plus, it will use excessive energy for the quantity of heat you desire produced. If the system is too small, then your house won't be warmed properly and the system will have to constantly run to try to heat the whole house, which will increase heating expenses.<p>
<p>Air conditioners can create a lot of water because they remove wetness from the air. To eliminate this, they have a typically plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can block this pipe and, when it does, the AC won't work. In reality, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the location. To handle condensate problems, please see Ac system Leaks Water, listed below.<p>
