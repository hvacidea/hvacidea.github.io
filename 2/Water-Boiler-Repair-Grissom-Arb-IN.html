A ductless unit has a built-in performance benefit due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leaks in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are great for additions because they don't need any brand-new ductwork to be installed.

<h3>HVAC Companies in Grissom Arb IN</h3>
<p>I typically don't leave reviews however wished to share my experience. You don't expect needing to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my alternatives. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss choices. I scheduled my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
