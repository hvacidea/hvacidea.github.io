<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical product with time.
