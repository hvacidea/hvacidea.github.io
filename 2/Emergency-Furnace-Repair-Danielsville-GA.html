<p>When we remodel or add on a space, we frequently install small built-in electric space heating systems. Unlike heat pumps, these units are self-contained. They are also safe compared to older-style electric baseboard heating systems. They can be found in many different kinds: wall-mounted units that are great for small areas like bathrooms, cove heating systems that are similar to baseboard heating systems but are tucked securely up by the ceiling, and ceiling-mounted convected heat panels that supply a gentle sunshine-like warmth from above.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires before disconnecting anything (you may need a referral later on). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
