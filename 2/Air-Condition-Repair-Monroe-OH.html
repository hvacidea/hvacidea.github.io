<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor system as near your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
