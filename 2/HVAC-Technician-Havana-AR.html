<p>If you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz, you're most likely hearing the fan motor trying to begin without the increase it needs from the capacitor. You can often conclude that the capacitor has actually stopped working. Often you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pressing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the chances are great that this may work for one cycle, but the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's best to replace the capacitor.<p>
<p>If the condenser coils are clogged, the compressor can overheat and shut down. You'll experience periodic durations of very little cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you make certain" the condenser coils are tidy, clean them again. Shut off the power. Turn the cooling service and furnace breaker in your main electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, shut off the power change right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the detach block (Photo 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Photo 2). If the cooling service still doesn't work effectively after you've cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC won't work totally unless you do this.<p>
