The reduced airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers.

Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the problem.<p>
