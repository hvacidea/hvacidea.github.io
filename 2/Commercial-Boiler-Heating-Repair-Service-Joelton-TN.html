<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government agency, performed a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy costs by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no considerable improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency.
