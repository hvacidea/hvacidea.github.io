<p>The Canada Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, performed a study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, determined particle levels in fact increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Numerous factors impact IAQ. These factors consist of poor ventilation (lack of outside air), issues controlling temperature level, low or high humidity, recent renovation, and other activities in or near a structure that can impact the fresh air entering into the structure. Sometimes, specific contaminants like dust from construction or restoration, mold, cleaning materials, pesticides, or other airborne chemicals (consisting of percentages of chemicals launched as a gas in time) might cause poor IAQ.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company because the two service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
