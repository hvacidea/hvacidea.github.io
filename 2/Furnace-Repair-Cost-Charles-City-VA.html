<p>The contaminants listed in this guide have actually been revealed to cause the health impacts discussed.

<p>3. Gas Heating systems While the cost of heating your house with a gas furnace is usually higher than many heat pump choices, they can still be extremely effective, depending on the model you acquire.

<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a building as relatively unchanged physical product with time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
