<p>When they're shut down and then repowered, ac systems and thermostats have integrated delay functions. The delay can be as long as 10 minutes. And, if you've subscribed to an energy-saving device from your local power utility, the system can take even longer to reset. If you've installed the parts revealed and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the system doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
<p>Often, indoor air quality problems in large commercial structures can not be effectively recognized or remedied without an extensive structure examination. These examinations might start with written surveys and telephone consultations in which structure detectives assess the history of resident signs and building operation treatments. In many cases, these inquiries might quickly reveal the problem and on-site visits are unneeded.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ might see musty or undesirable odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are worsening, speak to your doctor about them. But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no alternative to great structure management.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, damp air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil absorbs heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your home. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface area of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
