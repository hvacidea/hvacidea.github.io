<p>We tend to think about air contamination as something outdoors - ozone, smog, or haze hanging in the air, especially in summer season. These convection heaters are still widely utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Cleaning the air inside your home is more vital now than it ever has actually been.

Fortunately, our experienced air quality group can help you recognize and remedy any concerns with your air quality, and set up high quality items to help you delight in cleaner, much safer air in your house.<p>
