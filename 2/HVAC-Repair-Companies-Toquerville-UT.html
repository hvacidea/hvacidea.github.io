<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as designed. Wetness management and humidity control may contravene efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to save energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperature levels (style levels), instead of the higher temperature levels in some cases utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for most of the US and many parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not need additional cooling to provide thermal convenience inside your home.
