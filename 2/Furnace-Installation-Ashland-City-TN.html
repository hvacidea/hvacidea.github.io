<p>The main problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, employees try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more difficulties, given that a few of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the cooling separately for each room.

<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c unit works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the circulation system.<p>
