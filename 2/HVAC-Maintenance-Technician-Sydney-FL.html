<p>Geothermal heatpump are exceptionally effective, because ground source heating is extracted from depths where the temperature is constantly at a continuous temperature. These systems can attain a geothermal effectiveness of about 300 to 600 percent during the, Coldest winter nights; whereas air-source heat pumps can only achieve an effectiveness of about 175 to 250 percent on the coldest days of winter season.
