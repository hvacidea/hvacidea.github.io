<p>It's a fact that a new furnace for your house is among the more substantial costs associated with own a home. But, it ought to also be seen as a long-term investment. All of the current heating systems are a lot more energy-efficient than those installed even 20 years ago.

<p>Asthmatic kids are particularly at danger. EPA estimates that exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the number of episodes and intensity of symptoms in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic children, and might cause countless nonasth-matic children to establish the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition worsened by direct exposure to previously owned smoke each year. Direct exposure to previously owned smoke triggers nose, eye, and throat irritation. It may impact the cardiovascular system and some research studies have actually linked direct exposure to pre-owned smoke with the beginning of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ DETAILS), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
<p>A third way to choose whether your house might have poor indoor air quality is to look at your way of life and activities. Human activities can be considerable sources of indoor air pollution. Lastly, look for signs of issues with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can show your house might not have enough ventilation consist of moisture condensation on windows or walls, smelly or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment, and areas where books, shoes, or other items become moldy. To identify odors in your home, action outside for a couple of minutes, and then upon reentering your home, note whether smells are visible.<p>
<p>The predominant health result associated with direct exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might pose dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
