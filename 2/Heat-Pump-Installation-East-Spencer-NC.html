<p>Elements that can contribute to the growth of biological contaminants are wet or wet building materials (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and inadequately preserved humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioning system. "Humidifier fever" is a common health problem brought on by inappropriate maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs. Various fungis and germs grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these contaminants can be distributed into the air and breathed in by the building occupants. Other possible sources of biological contaminants are pets and family plants.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, typically referred to as central air" or split-system a/c", circulate cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the floorings, walls, or ceilings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning system to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it circulates through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Find out how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
