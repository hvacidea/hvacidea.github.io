The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh makeup air helps and waters down indoor contaminants tire them from the house.<p>

In some cases, specific contaminants like dust from building or remodelling, mold, cleaning materials, pesticides, or other air-borne chemicals (including percentages of chemicals launched as a gas with time) may trigger bad IAQ.<p>
