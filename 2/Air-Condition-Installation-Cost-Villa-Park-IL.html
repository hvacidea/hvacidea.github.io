<p>Weatherization usually does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes release toxins.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Second, identification of contaminant sources is typically vital to figuring out the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such info can often be acquired by requesting copies of air monitoring information from the company. If keeping track of data is not readily available, yet a high variety of health signs have been reported, the Union agent must ask for that the employer have air tracking tests performed.

However, when contaminant concentrations are very low, keeping track of data might not discuss the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
