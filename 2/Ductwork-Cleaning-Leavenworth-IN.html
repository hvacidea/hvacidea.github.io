<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Design, Building and Commissioning is developed for designers, style engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other professionals interested in indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house include building products, smoking, home products, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene space heaters. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a number of purposes in produced items. For example, it is used to include permanent-press qualities to clothing and draperies, as a component of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and finish products.<p>
<p>When filters aren't replaced or cleaned up regularly, they can become obstructed with particles that can restrict air flow, possibly impacting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Unclean filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases cause the system to shut down entirely. By contrast, inspecting and replacing a furnace filter can generally be done in simply a couple of minutes, typically without any tools needed. As a preventative measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, typically installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
