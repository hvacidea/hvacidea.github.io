<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We recommend you do the very same. As soon as the circuitry is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable warms. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately treat and solidify-- typically two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom floor.<p>
