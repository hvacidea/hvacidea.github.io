<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services at New Port Richey FL</h3>
<p>I admit I have not done the mathematics lately, however I've had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular evaluations. Likewise, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right away, and when I replaced my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their work with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits. I feel like they give me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little more for that comfort.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and well-informed. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
