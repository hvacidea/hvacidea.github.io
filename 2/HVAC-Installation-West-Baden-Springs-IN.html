<h3>Working of an HVAC System at West Baden Springs IN</h3>

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you may need a reference later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors should snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Protect the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
