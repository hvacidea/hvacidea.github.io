<p>In addition, worker health signs such as colds, headaches, drowsiness, inflammation, and irregular breathing might be caused as the result of temperature level extremes, improper humidity levels, and insufficient or too much air circulation.

<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases give off toxins.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the amount of outside air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
