<p>Central air units are determined in loads. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>

<p>Filters can get filthy quickly, specifically if you reside in a location that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all type of dust, particles, bacteria, and clean the air. They are accountable for preserving the indoor air quality. If they're not cleaned up and changed routinely, your HVAC system will eventually stop performing as you anticipate it to. The heating & cooling will be inefficient and the indoor air quality will intensify. Checking and changing the air filters is among the most important aspects of HVAC maintenance.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that launch gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality issues. Insufficient ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating sufficient outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air toxins out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.<p>
