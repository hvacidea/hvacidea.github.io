<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system likewise might contribute to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not changed regularly might end up being clogged up, lowering air circulation distribution, quality, and volume.

<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical product in time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as intricate systems. Research applying the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
