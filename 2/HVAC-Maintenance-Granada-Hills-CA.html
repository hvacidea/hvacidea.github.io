<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is minimized, however it is also more humid, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the sensible heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be rather significant.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited making use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
