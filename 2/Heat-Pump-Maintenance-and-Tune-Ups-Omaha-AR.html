<p>To put this simply, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO maintain the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, numerous studies through DOE and ACCA can confirm this if you're interested. However, select your contractor sensibly, many of the 'reliable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to incorrect sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Once again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a credible company, you still need to do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable score are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>A packaged system, usually installed on the roof, is most typically used on commercial structures, but it is also an option for property owners to think about. Many times, these units consist of not just the air conditioning system itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is certainly the cost. Packaged systems are fantastic for those seeking to save money on the installation of a new heating and cooling system separately, considering that the unit is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are usually just offered for larger houses due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a good way to conserve money on a complete HVAC system, they're still significantly more costly than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best alternative for homeowners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budgets.<p>
