<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
