<p>Steam-based systems tend to be older, and were preferred in the very first half of the 20th century, particularly in commercial buildings, apartment buildings and large houses. Many steam and radiator boiler systems set up more than 50 years ago stay operable, since the absence of moving parts makes them less prone to use and tear. A steam boiler replacement costs in between $4,000 and $30,000, depending upon boiler size.<p>

That said, homebuyers seeking to go green," who focus on energy savings, or who absolutely desire an in-floor heater will want to pay a premium for a house that features one.<p>
