Other's experiences with the company can answer these and numerous other concerns.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Contribute to Air Quality Issues. HVAC systems can also exacerbate indoor air quality problems.

<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' type of maintenance as I've checked out here). The heat exchanger had a really small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
