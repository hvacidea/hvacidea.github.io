Incorrect adjustment, frequently indicated by a consistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased pollutant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame suggestion is blue. Consider buying one with pilotless ignition since it does not have a pilot light that burns continually if you purchase a new gas stove or range. Never ever utilize a gas range to heat your house. When the fireplace is in usage, always make particular the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
