<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price fantastic however Mark went out of his way to customize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

(He literally stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
