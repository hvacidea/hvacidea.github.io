<p>Great service within 24 hours and a fair rate. The technician (Camryn) was extremely thorough and on-time in describing what services would be performed. Similarly Camryn offered terrific customer support at the end of the consultation by describing precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater.

<p>Central air conditioning is a high-end not everybody can manage, so many Seattleites must find ways to fight the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in action to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in huge box shops like Best Buy, package fans and window AC systems are taken up as soon as they're stacked in floor screens.
