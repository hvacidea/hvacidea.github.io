<p>If you presume a mold issue-- either because of noticeable growth or a moldy odor regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce moisture. Again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
