<p>Specialist heating system setups. However, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately stop working. HVAC professionals suggest following this fundamental guideline when choosing whether it deserves buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the rate of a new system, it's finest to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have a lot more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than essential.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts include the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which predicts airflows and impurity concentrations in multizone building systems.

CONTAM has been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in large mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school structures.<p>
