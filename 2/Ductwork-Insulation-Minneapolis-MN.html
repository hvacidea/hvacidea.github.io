<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We suggest you do the same. As soon as the electrical wiring is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable warms. Do not put the system into complete operation up until the thin-set and grout have had time to properly cure and solidify-- usually 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
<p>After the system has been looked for leaks, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside must be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
