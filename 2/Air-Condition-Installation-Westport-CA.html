<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not provide off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can happen in time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to work until you buy a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
