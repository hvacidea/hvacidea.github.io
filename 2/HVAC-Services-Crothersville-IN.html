<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based.

Portable instruments utilized to determine carbon dioxide ought to be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements used for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors might also be essential.<p>
