This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and flowed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

<p>Radiant heat covers a series of various heater, including electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable concepts.
