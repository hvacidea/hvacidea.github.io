<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, however furnace specialists frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be totally depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>
<p>More typical in reasonably older houses, a boiler-based heating system utilizes electrical power, oil or gas to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in specific spaces. All-electric boilers can attain up to 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers need to accomplish 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers should accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

<h3>Working of an HVAC System at Brightwood VA</h3>

EPA research studies of human exposure to air contaminants suggest that indoor levels of contaminants may be 2 to 5 times-- and occasionally more than 100 times-- greater than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board regularly rank indoor air contamination amongst the leading five environmental health threats to the public.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood just what the problem was and repaired it extremely quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
