<h3>Why Choose a Pure Gas Furnace in New Caney TX?</h3>
<p>Sean was extremely practical. He is a really enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure used to purchase additional things. Answered all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns besides the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
