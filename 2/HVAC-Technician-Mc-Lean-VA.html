He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call business several years back and know the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's again, and would advise them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you might choose to replace the outside compressor with a contemporary, high-efficiency system. If you do so, speak with a local heating and cooling contractor to assure that the new compressor is appropriately matched to the indoor system. Nevertheless, thinking about current modifications in refrigerants and a/c designs, it might be better to change the entire system.<p>
