<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external system to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system creates more problems, considering that a few of indoor systems can be located far from the exterior. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
