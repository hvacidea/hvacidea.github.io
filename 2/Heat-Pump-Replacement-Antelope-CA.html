<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task finding the outdoor system as close to your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Recent Review: They were great! A lot of HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally requested. They fulfilled my requirements totally by providing a professional quote with options, without pressing extra items. The crew showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and ended up a little early. The likewise immediately followed up with the necessary assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
