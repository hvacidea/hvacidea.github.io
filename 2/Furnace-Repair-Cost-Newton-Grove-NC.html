<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have very small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the auto debit, although my company does not offer car debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash being available in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to use auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Agreement.. There must not be any reason why your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was polite and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<h3>Install New Air Conditioner in Newton Grove NC</h3>
<p>I typically do not leave reviews but wished to share my experience. You don't expect needing to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over options. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
<p>Start by raising the lower sash, and then measure the height and width of the opening. When shopping for an air conditioner to ensure it'll fit conveniently into the window, be sure to have those dimensions on hand. Also, keep fire security in mind when choosing where to set up the air conditioning system: Do not put it in an egress window that functions as the only ways of escape should a fire appear.<p>
<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO maintain the performance and efficiency of your HVAC system, multiple research studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor wisely, a lot of the 'respectable' contractors touted by Angie's list are not unsusceptible to inappropriate sales methods that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is an excellent base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a trusted company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>It is not practical to develop a universal guideline suitable for all in regards to direct exposure and health since immunity varies significantly from individual to individual. EDLab at Pure Air Control Services carried out a 10 year research study examining more than 7,000 structures and over 25,000 ecological samples that were collected throughout the United States and abroad. The structure type included both commercial and residential. Most of samples evaluated were checked favorable for fungis and bacteria.<p>
