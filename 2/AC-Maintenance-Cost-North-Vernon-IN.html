<p>Indoor air pollution is caused by burning solid fuel sources - such as fire wood, crop waste, and dung - for cooking and heating. The job of an HVAC technician is relatively complicated and can differ significantly from one home or office to the next. Every maintenance job and repair is different from the last. Every maintenance job may require completely different actions and procedures than the previous, depending upon the age and condition of the system being examined. Installations can also differ substantially, depending upon the age of the structure and how well the existing system was set up. Sometimes, completely new ductwork may need to be set up in a structure that had none before.<p>
