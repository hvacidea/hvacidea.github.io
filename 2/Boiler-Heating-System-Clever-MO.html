<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives ask for assessment and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, a number of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
