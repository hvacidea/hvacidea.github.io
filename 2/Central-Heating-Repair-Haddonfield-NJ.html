<p>If you operate in building and construction, demolition, painting, with batteries, in a radiator service center or lead factory, or your hobby involves lead, you might unconsciously bring lead into your home on your clothing or hands. You may likewise be tracking in lead from soil around your home. Soil very near homes may be polluted from lead paint on the exterior of the building. Soil by highways and roads may be polluted from years of exhaust fumes from cars and trucks that used leaded gas. Use door mats to wipe your feet before getting in the home. If you work with lead in your task or a hobby, alter your clothes before you go home and wash these clothing individually. Motivate your kids to play in sand and grassy locations instead of dirt which sticks to fingers and toys. Try to keep your children from eating dirt, and make sure they clean their hands when they come inside.<p>
