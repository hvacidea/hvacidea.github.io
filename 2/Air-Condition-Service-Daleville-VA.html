<p>In a packaged central air conditioning conditioner, the compressor, evaporator, and condenser are all located in one cabinet, which typically is put on a roof or on a concrete slab beside your house's structure. This type of a/c unit also is used in small commercial structures. Air supply and return ducts come from indoors through the house's exterior wall or roofing system to get in touch with the packaged air conditioning unit, which is generally situated outdoors.

<p>Due to the fact that they get rid of moisture from the air, Air conditioners can create a lot of water. To get rid of this, they have a typically plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Gradually, algae can block this pipe and, when it does, the AC will not work. In reality, some condensate drains pipes have a float switch that will not let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the unit or flood the area.
