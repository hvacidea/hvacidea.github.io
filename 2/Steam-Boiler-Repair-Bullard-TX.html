<p>Ask about training and accreditations. A good place to start is the North American Technician Quality (NATE) certification. It's type of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, but a great deal of contractors out there have not bothered with it!

<p>Indoor environments are extremely complex and building occupants may be exposed to a range of contaminants (in the type of particles and gases) from workplace machines, cleaning products, building carpets, furnishings and activities, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure materials, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outside contaminants. Other factors such as indoor temperatures, relative humidity, and ventilation levels can also impact how people respond to the indoor environment.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture, Air cleaning occurs. The goal is to supply adequate modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A typical component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) supplies assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
