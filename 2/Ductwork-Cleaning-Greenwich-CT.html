<h3>Electric Heating System in Greenwich CT</h3>
<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (for the most part) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and circuit breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance products that just a trained HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to pricey compressor failure, however a homeowner doesn't have the tools or abilities needed to inspect refrigerant levels. Also, clean ducts and appropriate airflow are necessary to a well-functioning system, but homeowners lack the required equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart property owner, it's still needed to have an expert technician check the system occasionally.<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: They were terrific! A lot of HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to offer you with the service originally asked for.

And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
