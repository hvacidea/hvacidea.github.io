<p>If you set it too low, you're motivating the development of mold in damp air. The heat dries the air, avoiding mold growth and pollution. Of course, too-dry air can also aggravate your lungs and sinuses, while too much indoor humidity can contribute to the growth of bacteria and viruses, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a house is around half, according to the American Lung Association.<p>
