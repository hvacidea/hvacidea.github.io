<p>WE ARE ALSO USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe between the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the traditional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the standard water heater.

An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were noted on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was finished in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
