<h3>Heating And Cooling Services in Henderson TX</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
