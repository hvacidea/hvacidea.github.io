<p>Though it might be tough to think, the air inside your home can be even worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are infamous for lowering the air quality in your house, but there are lots of other toxins that can not just dirty up the air, however lead to other health issues. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and building products add to bad air quality, and can also trigger cancers. VOCs (unstable organic compounds) from paint and even from some type of carpets and upholstery products can cause issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be culprits, too.<p>
<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ might observe undesirable or moldy smells or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. But not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to great structure management.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you might choose to replace the outdoor compressor with a contemporary, high-efficiency unit. Seek advice from a local heating and cooling contractor to guarantee that the brand-new compressor is correctly matched to the indoor system if you do so. Nevertheless, considering recent modifications in refrigerants and a/c styles, it may be smarter to change the entire system.<p>
