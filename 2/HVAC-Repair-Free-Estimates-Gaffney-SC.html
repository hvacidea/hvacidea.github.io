<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - haze, smog, or ozone hanging in the air, specifically in summer season. These convection heating units are still commonly utilized and are generally called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating aspect in the furnace throughout which air is blown. This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is typically oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>For example, impurities may gather within the air diffusers and grills, presenting pollutants into the environment. Or if the outside air consumption is located near a source of moisture or other outdoor toxin, it might function as a path to bring the impurities inside. Or the ventilation system might not be working along with it should-- if debris is blocking the outside air consumption, for example, or the filters are contaminated or improperly kept.<p>
