<p>Examine these 3 things initially if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make certain all the signs up in your home are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the minimized air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the issue.<p>
