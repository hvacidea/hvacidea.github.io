<p>Elements that can contribute to the growth of biological contaminants are damp or moist building products (carpets, ceilings, walls) and improperly maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioning unit. "Humidifier fever" is a typical disease caused by incorrect maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and persistent coughs. Various fungis and bacteria grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these pollutants can be distributed into the air and inhaled by the structure occupants. Other possible sources of biological pollutants are pets and household plants.<p>
<p>Check these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in the house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). The reduced air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged. Deice the A-coil if you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to check it. You've solved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
