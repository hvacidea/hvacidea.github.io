<p>Recent Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>I am really impressed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the problem within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company many years ago and know the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm likewise satisfied that he appeared at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You very much.<p>
