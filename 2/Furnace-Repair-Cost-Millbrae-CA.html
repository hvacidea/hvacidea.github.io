<h3>Check Out Ductwork At Millbrae CA Commercial Buildings</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, carried out a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased right away after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<h3>AC Maintenance Near Me in Millbrae CA</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump heating & cooling systems act much like conventional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas by means of a duct system. A ducted heatpump system might be most affordable if your home or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape. Using existing ductwork will remove the need to set up a pricey brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

Considering larger systems cost more than smaller sized units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC unit your central air system needs to hold.<p>
