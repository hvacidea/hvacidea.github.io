<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heatpump is added since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus declining its efficiency.<p>
