Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some toxins.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the cost great however Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit installed. I believe any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
