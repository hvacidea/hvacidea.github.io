<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair in Granger IN</h3>
<p>All contemporary air conditioning systems, even small window plan systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions necessitate. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. Additionally, very unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
