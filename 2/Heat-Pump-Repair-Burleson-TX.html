<p>Packaged terminal ac system (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often used in hotels, have two different units (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This decreases the interior system footprint and enables each room to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to supply heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the ac system into a heat pump While space air conditioning supplies optimum flexibility, when used to cool numerous spaces at a time it is typically more costly than central air.<p>
