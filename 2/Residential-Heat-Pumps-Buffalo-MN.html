What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my alternatives. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
