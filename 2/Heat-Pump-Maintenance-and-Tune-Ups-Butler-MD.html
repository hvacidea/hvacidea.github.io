<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
