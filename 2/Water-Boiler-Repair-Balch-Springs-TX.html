Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical throughout the pushing and ending up procedures.

Attempt a various dry cleaner if items with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent sees.<p>
