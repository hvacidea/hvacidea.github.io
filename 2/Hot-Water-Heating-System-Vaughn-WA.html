<p>Excellent Product! Shipment was kind of unusual being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all intact. The product was exceptionally lite weight and requires time to use. Keep in mind: purchase recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to view the video first prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we fixed problems. I would suggest this product to anybody who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the very first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
