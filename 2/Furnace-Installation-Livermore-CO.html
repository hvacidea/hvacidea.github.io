<p>The primary problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, workers try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system develops more troubles, given that some of indoor systems can be situated far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not allow you to set the cooling individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor units operate independently from each other.<p>
