After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no substantial improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance.

In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have actually found them to be reasonably priced, timely and do fine work.

No additional charge.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the effectiveness of dilution.
