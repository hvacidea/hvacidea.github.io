<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
