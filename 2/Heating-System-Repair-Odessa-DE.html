This warmed air is then distributed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The process repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is generally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Dirty filters are the most typical cause of furnace problems.
