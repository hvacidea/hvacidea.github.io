<p>I usually do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You do not expect needing to replace your AC unit. Unfortunately for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and talk about options. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>

EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year.
