<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage.
