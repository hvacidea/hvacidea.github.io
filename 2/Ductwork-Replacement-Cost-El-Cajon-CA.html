<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>HVAC is a fundamental part of residential structures such as single household homes, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to large industrial and office complex such as high-rise buildings and healthcare facilities, lorries such as vehicles, trains, ships, aircrafts and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are controlled with regard to temperature and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>Current Review: They were terrific! A lot of HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service initially requested. They met my requirements completely by supplying an expert quote with alternatives, without pressing additional products. The team appeared on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The also immediately followed up with the necessary inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
