<p>While these steps will assist to keep your AC system in leading shape, understand that there are maintenance items that just a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can lead to pricey compressor failure, however a house owner doesn't have the tools or skills essential to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and proper airflow are essential to a well-functioning system, however house owners do not have the needed equipment for the task. The bottom line?
