Nevertheless, pick your contractor carefully, much of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed property owners. Again, think about the source, Angie's list is a paid website with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a respectable company, you still must do your research (not all contractors with a similar ranking are the same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (Air conditioning contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
