He devoted to the task based just on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the couple of reasonable ones received. Others were almost twice the amount Protex estimated for low end off brand equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex properly advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up team was considerate of my home and set up the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post set up inspection results look great for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 unit it changed (likewise Provider).<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
