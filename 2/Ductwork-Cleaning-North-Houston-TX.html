<p>While radon in water is not an issue in homes served by many public water supplies, it has been discovered in well water. If you have actually tested the air in your home and discovered a radon problem, and you have a well, contact a lab certified to measure radiation in water to have your water evaluated. Radon problems in water can be easily repaired. Call your state radon office or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to learn more.<p>
<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very valuable in gathering details on the phone and offering clear instructions about how to momentarily cope with the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and used clear interaction about the issue, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly utilize Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid beads and strong particles suspended in the air, such as dust, soot, smoke, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings by means of mechanical and natural ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, smoking, or other activities.<p>
