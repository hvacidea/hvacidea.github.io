<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the price terrific however Mark went out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

<p>Sean was really valuable. He is a very enjoyable individual to work with. No pressure applied to buy extra things. Addressed all the questions that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no problems besides the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not install the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the concern is.<p>
