He knew simply what the problem was and repaired it extremely rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>
