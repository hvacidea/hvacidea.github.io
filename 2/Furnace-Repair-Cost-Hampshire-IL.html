<p>, if the hvac company didn't come out ahead they wouldn't offer contracts.. The so called reputable companies dupe more individuals than the fly by night attire.

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and banned using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation prohibited making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This implies that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
