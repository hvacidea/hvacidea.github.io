<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
