<p>Radiant heating covers a range of various heating systems, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
