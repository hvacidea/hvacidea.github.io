<p>Next, and possibly just as crucial when it concerns central air conditioning expenses, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have a simple time keeping the house cool, but will have a more difficult time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not be able to correctly cool the house on hot days. Thinking about bigger systems cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air system needs to hold.<p>
