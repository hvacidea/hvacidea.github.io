<p>House owners may also presume that because a radiant flooring heating system can be seen (and funded) as a house improvement, its installation will immediately raise their house's value. No evidence exists suggesting that in-floor heating either positively or negatively affects property values. In-floor heating is not even tracked in the annual Cost vs. Worth Report released by Hanley Wood Media, publishers of Improvement Magazine. Possibly Realtors need to consider too many variables to definitively state what a radiant heating system may contribute to, or deduct from, any offered asking rate. That stated, property buyers looking to go green," who focus on energy savings, or who definitely want an in-floor heating unit will want to pay a premium for a house that includes one.<p>
