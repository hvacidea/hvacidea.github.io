<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act just like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most cost effective if your home or building has an existing duct system that remains in good shape. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to install a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>. Before selecting the installation area of air conditioning system, numerous main elements need to be considered. First of all, the direction of air flow from the indoor units need to not fall on the location of rest or workspace.
