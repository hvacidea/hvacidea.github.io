<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
