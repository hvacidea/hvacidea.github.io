<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done.

<h3>HVAC Repair Free Estimates in Mount Judea AR</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what materials 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest won't come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer transforms the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your common wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that safeguard your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most typical areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a likelihood; you might have a water leakage in the attic. The water triggers your emergency safety switch, therefore cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This deactivates all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is likewise a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have seen baseplate spoil on unusual events.<p>
