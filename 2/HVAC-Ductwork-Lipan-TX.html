<p>Your full-service HVAC Repair and Installation Company. Even with routine preventive maintenance, though, there will constantly be the odd issue that periodically comes up. It is very important that you call G & S Heating Cooling & Electric as quickly as possible when you do discover your furnace behaving oddly. The faster you react to concerns with your furnace, the easier they are to fix. Waiting to call for repairs will just make the problem worse, and frequently more costly.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned frequently, they can become clogged with debris that can limit air flow, potentially affecting your comfort and your system's efficiency. Dirty filters can trigger additional wear and tear on furnace components and in more severe cases cause the system to close down completely. By comparison, changing a furnace and inspecting filter can usually be performed in simply a few minutes, frequently without any tools required. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make certain to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
