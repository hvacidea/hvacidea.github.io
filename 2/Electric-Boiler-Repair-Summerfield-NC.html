<p>When our furnace was passing away, we called 2 local companies for bids. While both were useful and helpful, Ballard Gas provided us a much better deal, for exceptional service. Instead of a simple sales job, the owner of the company made a complete assessment of our heating system and situated ways we might have more even heat. He included these minor but considerable adjustments in his bid. We decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump because of recent warmer summertimes and for ecological factors.<p>
