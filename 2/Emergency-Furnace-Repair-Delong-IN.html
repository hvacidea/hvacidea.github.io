<p>Poor indoor air quality is normally caused by the lack of appropriate ventilation, which leads to an accumulation of pollutants from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health recognized insufficient ventilation as the primary problem in majority the office indoor air investigations it has carried out. Investigations conducted in homes by the Illinois Department of Public Health have found the very same to be true. These investigations revealed that appropriate ventilation is important in maintaining great indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Asthmatic children are specifically at risk. EPA estimates that direct exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and severity of symptoms in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic kids, and might cause countless nonasth-matic kids to establish the disease each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic children have their condition made worse by direct exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Exposure to pre-owned smoke triggers eye, throat, and nose irritation. It might affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have connected direct exposure to previously owned smoke with the beginning of chest discomfort. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ INFO), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>

<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around repairing the issue, all the while describing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working appropriately. He needed to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will certainly utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
