Due to the fact that its condenser coil releases heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space.

<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
