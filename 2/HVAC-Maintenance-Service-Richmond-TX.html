<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Best Practices for Style, Construction and Commissioning is designed for designers, design engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other specialists worried about indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the house include structure products, smoking, home items, and the use of unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas ranges or kerosene space heaters. Formaldehyde, by itself or in mix with other chemicals, serves a number of functions in manufactured items. For instance, it is utilized to include permanent-press qualities to clothes and draperies, as an element of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and finish products.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside system as near your house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
