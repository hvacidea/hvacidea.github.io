<p>Biological contaminants consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these contaminants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by people and animals; germs are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander.
