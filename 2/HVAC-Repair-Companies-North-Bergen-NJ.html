<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so deal with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Do not put the condenser under a deck or completely confine it because it exhausts warm air out the top. Any air flow constraint will lower the unit's performance. You can, nevertheless, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>
<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them initially, which is why rooms warmed by radiators are prone to cold spots", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and very hot next to the radiators.
