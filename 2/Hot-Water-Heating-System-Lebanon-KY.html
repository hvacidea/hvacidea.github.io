<p>Current Evaluation: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and knowledgeable. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
