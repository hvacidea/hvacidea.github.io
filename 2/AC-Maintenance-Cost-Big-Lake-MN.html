<p>At present, EPA does not suggest utilizing air cleaners to decrease levels of radon and its decay products. The effectiveness of these gadgets is uncertain since they just partially get rid of the radon decay items and do not diminish the amount of radon going into the home. EPA plans to do additional research on whether air cleaners are, or could become, a reliable means of minimizing the health risk from radon. EPA's brochure, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, provides further details on air-cleaning gadgets to minimize indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>The cost to repair AC duct runs in between $300 to $500 on average.

Setting up new ductwork for the entire home will cost approximately between $8,900 and $12,300.<p>
