<p>Radiant heating covers a range of various heating systems, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar concepts. When it comes to a boiler, the system warms by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each room. In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
