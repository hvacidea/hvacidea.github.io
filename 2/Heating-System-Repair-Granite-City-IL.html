<h3>HVAC Furnace Air Filters - Things You Must Know Before Buying in Granite City IL</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon hot water heater. It went terrific. Working with Braxten was a satisfaction. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating system. We chose getting something more expensive than a conventional water heater as gas is among our greatest utility expenses. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and usage extremely little energy to heat water.<p>

<p>When the heat pump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was extremely helpful in collecting info on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to temporarily manage the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and provided clear interaction about the problem, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began.
