<h3>Steam Boiler Repair in Wagener South Carolina</h3>

Initially, heatpump HVAC systems were only used in moderate climates, however with improvements in low temperature operation and reduced loads due to more effective homes, they are increasing in appeal in cooler climates.<p>

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is brought on by a plugged filter. Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
