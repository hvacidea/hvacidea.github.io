<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the very same. As soon as the wiring is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to appropriately cure and solidify-- normally 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>
