<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job locating the outside system as near to your home as possible per my request. The task took 2 days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really knowledgeable of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

I thought for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
