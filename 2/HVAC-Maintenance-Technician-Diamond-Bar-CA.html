The only method to understand if there is lead in drinking water is to have it checked. Contact the local health department or the water supplier to discover how to get the water checked. Send out for the EPA pamphlet, Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more information about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to find out more.<p>
