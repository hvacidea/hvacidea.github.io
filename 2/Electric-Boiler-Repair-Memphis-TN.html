<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a recommendation later on). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each port to see if it's tight. Get rid of the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually switched all the wires.<p>
