<p>Lead has actually long been recognized as a hazardous toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " number one environmental threat to the health of kids in the United States." There are numerous ways in which human beings are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. When a specific breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled, Airborne lead gets in the body.
