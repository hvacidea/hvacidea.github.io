<p>I have actually been utilizing them for years for my organisations, my own houses and my realty customers' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies estimated me with various costs and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who described to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another occasion. When I called and he encouraged me to call warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again, he helped me problem shoot the issue. He is honest, dependable, and sensible on rate. It's tough to discover an honest AC man and I'm glad I found Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>

The likewise immediately followed up with the needed evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
