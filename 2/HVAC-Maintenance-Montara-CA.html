<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for consultation and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. The probability of immediate responses to indoor air contaminants depends upon several elements including age and preexisting medical conditions. In some cases, whether an individual responds to a toxin depends upon individual sensitivity, which varies significantly from individual to person. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological or chemical pollutants after duplicated or high level direct exposures.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine parts. To avoid this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs dealt with by professionals, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
