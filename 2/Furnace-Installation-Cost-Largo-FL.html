<p>Next, and maybe just as important when it pertains to central air costs, is the AC unit's size. An unit that is too large will have a simple time keeping the home cool, however will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not have the ability to correctly cool the home on hot days.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
