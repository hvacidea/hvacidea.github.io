<p>Recent Evaluation: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
