<p>Employers are required to follow the General Duty Provision of the OSHAct, which requires them to offer employees with a safe office that does not have any recognized threats that trigger or are most likely to trigger death or severe injury.

Employers must be fairly knowledgeable about the possible sources of bad air quality, and they need to have the resources necessary to acknowledge and control workplace threats. It is likewise their duty to inform staff members of the instant threats that are present.Specific state and local regulations may apply.<p>
<p>If you notice a decrease in heat output, initially ensure the air filter is tidy and in good condition. Next, check other components of the furnace for any build-up of dirt, particles and dust, a low-cost fix that can help boost efficiency. Likewise, check the vents and ducts for obstruction. Finally, make sure the thermostat is working and located appropriately.
