<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment normally lasts decades, considering that it is secured indoors. When it does require to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, because the loop or well is the most expensive to install. New technical standards remove the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot gradually, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to function.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you should inspect your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly if totally iced over.<p>
