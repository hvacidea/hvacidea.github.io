<p>Customer products that contain methylene chloride consist of paint strippers, adhesive removers, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is understood to cause cancer in animals. Likewise, methylene chloride is converted to carbon monoxide in the body and can cause signs related to exposure to carbon monoxide. Thoroughly read the labels containing health hazard information and cautions on the appropriate use of these items. Use products which contain methylene chloride outdoors when possible; use inside only if the area is well ventilated.<p>
<p>Oil heaters are usually not very effective. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, however many do not achieve a performance higher than 90%. A couple of high-end brand names have an effectiveness of 95% by utilizing a condenser. These are more costly, having beginning costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. Because a drain needs to be set up, you pay more for the installation as well.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, thus the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it absorbs heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is soaked up from indoors and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
