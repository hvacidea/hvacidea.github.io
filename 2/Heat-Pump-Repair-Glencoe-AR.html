<h3>Tips to Help You Hire Glencoe AR Professionals for Air Conditioning Repair</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems need relatively little attention. However, just like any mechanical system, some fundamental maintenance is important to keep the system working efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit are similar to those of traditional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and storage tank need to be checked for leaks, the system ought to be flushed occasionally to remove tank and collected impurities (scaling in tough water locations). The systems ought to be checked a minimum of two times each year for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be rinsed periodically to get rid of dust gathered in order to improve collector performance.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often carried out in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
