<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often gets requests for consultation and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed many years ago are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>The effects of lead direct exposure on fetuses and young children can be serious.

Kids may have greater exposures because they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects into their mouths.<p>
