<h3>The Advantages of Buying A New Furnace in Hurricane UT</h3>
<p>After living in our house for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to replace the cooling. I proceeded and bought this Carrier and I must say it gets the job done quite well. It takes extremely little time to heat up or cool off your house which is among the things we didnâ $ t obtain from the one we had in the past. The unit hasnâ $ t needed any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He put in the time to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was educated and courteous. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
