<p>Packaged terminal a/c (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening going through the wall and connecting them. This reduces the interior system footprint and allows each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems might be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the a/c unit into a heatpump While room air conditioning offers optimum versatility, when utilized to cool numerous spaces at a time it is usually more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
