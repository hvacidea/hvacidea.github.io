<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate fantastic but Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified before the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set stronger indoor standards based on the most current science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor devices through codes, and after more powerful guidelines are set there is an opportunity to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Immediate effects may show up after a single direct exposure or duplicated exposures. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and tiredness. Such instant results are generally short-term and treatable. Sometimes the treatment is just getting rid of the person's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be determined. Symptoms of some diseases, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might likewise show up right after exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are sometimes more challenging to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or below 65%. The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold development.<p>
<p>Keep an eye out for indications of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable products, floor, wall, and ceiling coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have actually been damp for over 24 to 48 hours might become a source for mold growth and must be discarded. Often there is a moldy smell however mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can grow in hidden or hardly ever accessed locations of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring materials including carpet underpadding. Opportunities are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be found. Repair the wetness issue, either by locating the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly tidy the area utilizing established health department recommendations.<p>
