<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
