<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things initially. Make certain all the signs up in your home are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the decreased air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or till there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the issue.<p>
