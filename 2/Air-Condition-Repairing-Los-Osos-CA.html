<p>The split system is the most common. Many people are utilized to seeing this key in the backyards of houses. With split system units, most of the components are housed in a metal box beyond the home. Nevertheless, there are some internal parts too. Split systems are ideal for cooling multiple spaces at once, but are not extremely energy efficient. For that reason, one pro is not having loud devices in the home.

Possibilities are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be found.
