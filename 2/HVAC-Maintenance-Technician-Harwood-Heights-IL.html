<p>I have been using them for many years for my services, my own houses and my property clients' houses. I went through five other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All 5 other companies quoted me with various prices and various problems that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who discussed to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another event. He assisted me trouble shoot the issue when I called and he advised me to get in touch with service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again. He is sincere, trusted, and affordable on cost. It's tough to find a sincere AC man and I'm glad I found Luis. Highly advise Luis and his company.<p>
