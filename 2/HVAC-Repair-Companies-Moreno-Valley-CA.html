<p>Many people underestimate the level of the indoor air pollution issue. Air contamination is normally pictured as the black smoke released from factories. Little idea is offered to tobacco smoke and the spin-offs of aerosol sprays, paints, cleaners, and pesticides used in the house. To compound the problem, it is estimated that the typical American invests 70 percent to 90 percent of his or her time indoors, and more than half that time is spent in the home.<p>
<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are sometimes integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
