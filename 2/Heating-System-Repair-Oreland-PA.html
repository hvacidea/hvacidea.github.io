<p>Have utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. When I have concerns, they give me top priority and a lower rate. Purchased a brand-new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase prolonged guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't need.<p>
