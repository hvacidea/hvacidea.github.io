<p>Current Evaluation: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and experienced. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning systems are determined in lots. This measurement is based on the system's capability to cool your home. For instance, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in lots, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 lot system will cool 54,000 BTUs.
