<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either because of visible development or a musty smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and examine. Dripping return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Once again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
