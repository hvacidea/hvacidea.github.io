<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outdoor system as close to the house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very knowledgeable of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the job was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
