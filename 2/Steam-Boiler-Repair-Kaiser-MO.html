<p>Mark (owner) and team were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost great but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
