Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not comprehending", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>Great Item! Delivery was kind of strange being that package was opened and items could have fell out. However after evaluation of contents we ensured it was all intact.

We used the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all directions precisely. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets.
