<p>Though it might be hard to think, the air inside your home can be worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are well-known for lowering the air quality in your home, but there are lots of other pollutants that can not only unclean up the air, however result in other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning materials and structure products add to poor air quality, and can also trigger cancers.

<p>The cost for heat pump installation also depends upon the size of the unit and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter.<p>
