<h3>Advantages of Professional AC Repair in Chelmsford MA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, conducted a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

<p>This is particularly notable, as gas stoves can trigger levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas ranges have levels that can run from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with inadequately adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Individuals working in buildings with bad IAQ may see unpleasant or moldy smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting worse. However not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to excellent building management.<p>
