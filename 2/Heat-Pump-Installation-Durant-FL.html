Though just 33 percent of Seattle real estate units had air conditioning in 2015, more than 46,000 new real estate units have been built in the four years since or are currently under construction.

<p>If the condenser coils are obstructed, the compressor can get too hot and shut down. You'll experience intermittent periods of minimal cooling, followed by no cooling. Even if you're sure" the condenser coils are clean, clean them again. Switch off the power. Turn the air conditioning service and furnace circuit breakers in your primary electrical panel to the Off" position. Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then pull the detach block (Image 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Picture 2). If the air conditioning service still does not work effectively after you have actually cleaned up the condenser coils, installed a new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC won't work totally unless you do this.<p>
