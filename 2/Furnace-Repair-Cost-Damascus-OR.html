<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't successful you would not offer them.  Second of all like extended car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential abilities to do the job and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to properly service and the unit has been running issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
