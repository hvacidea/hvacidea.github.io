<p>Have actually used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC.
