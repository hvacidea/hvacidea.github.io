<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as a Necessary Company in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are rated 90% efficiency or better; it is not uncommon for a modern furnace to be rated 94 or 95% efficient.

Requirement air-source HVAC systems cost around $3,000 per ton of heating or cooling capacity, throughout brand-new building (houses usually use between one and 5 tons). Geothermal HVAC systems start at about $5,000 per load, and can go as high as $8,000 or $9,000 per heap. Nevertheless, new installation practices are reducing expenses, to the point where the cost is getting closer to traditional systems under the ideal conditions.<p>

<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either because of noticeable growth or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can inspect and keep. Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Once again, if you believe a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
