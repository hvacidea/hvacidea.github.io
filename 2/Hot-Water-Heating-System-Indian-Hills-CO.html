<p>Since it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes, I'll start with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is provided to the rooms of your home through ducts, and cool air is collected by means of cold air return vents. Gas furnaces are rated for performance. Older systems from the 1970s may be rated 65%, indicating 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your home already has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a fairly straightforward procedure. Setting up a new gas furnace system can be rather expensive if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>
