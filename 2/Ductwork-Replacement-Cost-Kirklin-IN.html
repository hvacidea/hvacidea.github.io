<h3>Energy Efficient Heaters in Kirklin Indiana</h3>
<p>Trace was the service technician that took care of my semi annual maintenance today. Trace was on time, courteous, and appreciated my home by constantly wearing boot coverings when entering my house. He demonstrated the points of examination and also suggested I have a UV light installed due to a small buildup of mold collecting in the air handler, which he thoroughly cleaned up the outside and examined compressor coils as well as ensured the moisture discharge tube was clear by utilizing a cleaning liquid and a shop vacuum. He also eliminated the leaves that collected inside the interior of the compressor system and recommended an option to avoid it from continuing, which will do.I received a detailed email report of the inspection detailing all the electronic measurements and service.Trace is an asset to Waychoff's and I highly suggest him and Waychoff's for service and installation.<p>
