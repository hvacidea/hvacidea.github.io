These consist of chemicals used in the building and construction or restoration of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds). In addition, appliances that burn gas can produce particulates and carbon monoxide Insufficient combustion and poor ventilation of these appliances (cook stoves, gas heaters, gas boilers, and gas hot water heater) can contribute to indoor pollutants. Gas cook tops must be utilized with fans that send out exhaust exterior.
