<p>We tend to think of air pollution as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer. Connection issues along the line that provides power to your furnace can jeopardize the efficiency of the system. Loose, missing or faulty wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and interrupt service. Part of maintaining your furnace involves checking the advised connections along with temperature level and pressure gauges. Require time to examine these parts for dust and damage, ensuring that they are tight and safe.<p>
