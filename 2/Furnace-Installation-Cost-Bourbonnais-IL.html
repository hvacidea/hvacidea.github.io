<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are sent by animals and people; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant debris; and home animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. When it dries, it can become airborne. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these impurities through the home.<p>
