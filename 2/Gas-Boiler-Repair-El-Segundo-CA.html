<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as created. Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to save energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperature levels (style levels), rather of the greater temperatures in some cases utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for most of the United States and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, throughout the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to offer thermal comfort inside. However, high humidity outdoors creates the need for careful attention to humidity levels indoors. High humidities give rise to mold growth and moisture inside is associated with a higher prevalence of resident breathing issues.<p>
<p>It is not suggested that "routine" occupational exposure limitations (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be used to figure out if the basic indoor air quality fulfills a specific requirement. Occupational direct exposure limits listed in health and safety policies and the Threshold Limitation Values ® (TLVs) suggested by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are meant as a guide to prevent disease or certain impacts (like eye and nose irritation) in industrial situations.
