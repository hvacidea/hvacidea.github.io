<p>Ensure there are no rugs, furniture, or anything else restricting the circulation of air. Not only will obstructed vents and signs up impact your comfort, they can likewise lead to duct leakages due to excessive air pressure and early HVAC repairs and breakdowns. Closing off vents and registers in unused spaces is NOT a great idea. You will not save any money and will wind up triggering more problems for your heater.<p>
<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>

According to the Department of Energy, older natural gas systems normally accomplish a 68 to 72 percent AFUE, while newer, highly efficient natural gas heating systems can achieve AFUE rankings as high as 90 to 97 percent.<p>
