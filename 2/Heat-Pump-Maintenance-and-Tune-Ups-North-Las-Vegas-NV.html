<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood simply what the problem was and fixed it really rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
