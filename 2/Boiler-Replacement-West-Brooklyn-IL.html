<h3>HVAC Repair And You What You Need to Understand in West Brooklyn IL</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
