<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
