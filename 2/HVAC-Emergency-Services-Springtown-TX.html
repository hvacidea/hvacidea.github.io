<h3>AC Unit Repair in Springtown Texas</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was knowledgeable & friendly throughout the check out. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost but a fast internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating prices, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they installed the week prior was faulty. No charge for the go to or the brand-new part. I was really pleased they waited their work and repaired the problem. Will absolutely be using them again.<p>

<p>Ignitor and Flame Sensors: â $ " Â When your HSI (hot surface area ignitor) or electronic lighter spoils, the furnace canâ $ t fire, and it closes down quickly. This is a really typical repair. If your furnace is more than 10 years old and youâ $ re having other service done on it, consider having the ignitor and flame sensing unit replaced as preventative maintenance since the cost will be less when the technician is currently there and has the furnace opened for repairs.<p>
