<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
