<p>A/c can also be provided by a procedure called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
