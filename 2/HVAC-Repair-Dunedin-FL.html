<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area.

Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thereby decreasing its efficiency.<p>
