Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has actually watched the single-family home installation business completely flip on its head the last few years. Winter used to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer season, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to up to three months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and the people." And not simply with newbies more familiar with AC living. Long time Seattle property owners are finally giving in, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend used in cars in the U.S. till 1994, when most styles altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12.

For systems requiring only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by many individuals.<p>
