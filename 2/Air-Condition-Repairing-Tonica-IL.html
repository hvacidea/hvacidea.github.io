<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil.
