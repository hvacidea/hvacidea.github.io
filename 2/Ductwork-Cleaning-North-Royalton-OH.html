<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a building as relatively unchanged physical product gradually.
