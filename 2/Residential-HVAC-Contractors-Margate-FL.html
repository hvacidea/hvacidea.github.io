<p>Right now, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, construction debris, and mold may be residing in your home's duct, impacting the air you breathe in addition to the effectiveness of your heating and cooling system. Indoor air quality isn't on most people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't concerned about it at all, according to a recent study by the Customer Reports National Research Center. But a number of the important things people do-- or don't do-- can contribute to the stew of air-borne contaminants in their homes and intensify asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>The modeling efforts consist of the development and application of multizone air flow and indoor air quality models, specifically the CONTAM series which anticipates airflows and pollutant concentrations in multizone structure systems. CONTAM is based upon a graphic interface that permits the user to draw layout on a "sketchpad" and employ "icons" to represent airflow courses, ventilation system parts, and contaminant sources. CONTAM has been utilized at NIST to study the indoor air quality impacts of HVAC systems in single-family residential structures, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office buildings, and radon entry and transport in large residential, office, and school structures.<p>
