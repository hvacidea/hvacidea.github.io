<p>An undersize system will not have the ability to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it has to run longer than a properly sized system. Since it just takes more electrical energy to run a larger system, a large-scale compressor also costs more to operate. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a chance to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential moisture. The result is a space that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In reality, the space can feel damp and clammy.<p>
