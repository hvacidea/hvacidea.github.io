<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply 8 to 10 years old, it might grovel two times the electricity that even a low-end new one would use. That's because it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to provide a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
