<h3>Heating Service in Croton On Hudson New York</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another system required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this person belittled me for my "not comprehending", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<h3>Preventive HVAC Care in Croton On Hudson NY</h3>
<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He devoted to the task based just on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the couple of sensible ones got. Others were almost twice the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand devices. I got Carrier. ProTex properly advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser even though it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install team was considerate of my house and set up the devices in the expected quantity of time. post set up evaluation outcomes look great for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 system it replaced (also Provider).<p>
