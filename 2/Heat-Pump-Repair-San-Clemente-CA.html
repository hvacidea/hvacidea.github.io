<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives ask for consultation and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal firms. Throughout the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. However, a number of these houses were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was installed several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Secondly, if you prepare to set up wall-to-wall carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, specifically concrete in basements, make certain that an effective moisture barrier is installed prior to installing the carpet. Do temporarily adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives so that the carpet can be removed if it ends up being wet.<p>
