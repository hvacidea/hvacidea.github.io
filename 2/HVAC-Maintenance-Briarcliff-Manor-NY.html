Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the patio area where the unit sits. I seem like they provide me favoritism, and am willing to pay a bit more for that comfort.<p>
