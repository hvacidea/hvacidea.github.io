<h3>AC Repair Contractor in Pattersonville NY</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what materials 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. Your Nest will not come on if your transformer malfunctions. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security switches that safeguard your air conditioning system from flooding. One of the most typical areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan.
