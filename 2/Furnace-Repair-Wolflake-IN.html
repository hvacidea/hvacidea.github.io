As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>

My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts years, since it is safeguarded inside your home.

New technical guidelines get rid of the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overheat or overcool the ground with time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to work.<p>
