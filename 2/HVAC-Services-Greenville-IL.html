I have 2 heating systems - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are simply crazy and all over the place and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>There are a couple of possibilities to discuss brief biking in really winter. The most apparent is the possibility of the high demands put on the system due to the very low temperature levels.

There are other possibilities such as a crack in the heat exchanger or a broken thermostat. If you need clearness on this problem, contact one of our service technicians.<p>
