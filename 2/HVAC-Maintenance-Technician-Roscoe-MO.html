<p>Great service within 24 hr and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and really comprehensive in describing what services would be carried out. Also Camryn offered fantastic customer care at the end of the visit by describing precisely what he had done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a couple of tips of some maintenance tasks we may want to have actually performed in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale tactics used by some in the market.<p>
