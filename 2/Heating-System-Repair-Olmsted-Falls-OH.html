<h3>The Most Frequent Reasons For Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. 2 on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the whole day as they required to remove the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high efficiency heating system. We selected getting something more pricey than a standard hot water heater as gas is one of our most significant energy costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is normally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
