Such a tool ought to identify the variety of individuals impacted; specify ages and task descriptions of involved workers; identify where they are located within the workplace; indicate when the symptoms occur (time of day, day of week, and season); provide a list of specific health symptoms or health problems; determine all makers operated in the office; indicate the kind of outside air contamination; and recognize potential sources of job tension.<p>
<p>The contaminants listed in this guide have actually been revealed to trigger the health effects mentioned.
