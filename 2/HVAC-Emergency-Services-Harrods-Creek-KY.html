<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that may affect the health of individuals who reside in the home. Contaminants could originate from outside the house-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon getting in the house from the ground listed below. An air toxin could also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, unstable organic substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or individual care products.
