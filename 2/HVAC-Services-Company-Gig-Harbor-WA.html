But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance breaker journeys.

Irritants found in indoor air are primarily biological material such as pet dander, cockroach and other insect pest particles, pollen, bacteria, and mold. All of these products are small particles, can become airborne, and hence, are easily inhaled. Allergens that are breathed in by sensitized people with asthma can trigger asthma attacks.

<p>Second, identification of pollutant sources is often crucial to identifying the cause( s) of employee health symptoms. Such info can in some cases be obtained by requesting copies of air monitoring data from the employer. If keeping track of data is not readily available, yet a high variety of health signs have been reported, the Union agent must request that the employer have air tracking tests performed. Evaluation of this information may recognize potentially harmful sources of contamination and resultant employee health symptoms. However, when contaminant concentrations are extremely low, keeping an eye on information might not discuss the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
