<p>Fantastic service within 24 hr and a fair rate. The technician (Camryn) was really thorough and on-time in describing what services would be carried out.

He made a few recommendations of some maintenance jobs we may wish to have actually carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale techniques employed by some in the industry.<p>
