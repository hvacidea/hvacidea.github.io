<p>Current Evaluation: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>If the AC does not switch off, it may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not give off heat effectively and will keep the system running. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can take place over time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This ought to do the trick till you purchase a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
