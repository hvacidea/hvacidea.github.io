<h3>AC Technician in La Crosse IN</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 rule but got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heating systems - one inside your home and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market value are just crazy and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

The installer will be utilizing the above noted devices, a Carrier, Convenience Series Single Stage Condenser, 31,000 BTUs. They are likewise setting up an Unico single Phase Blower module, and a Unico Evaporator Coil, 31,000 BTUs and a 12 SEER. They will be adding 3 (3) high velocity supply lines and recycle the existing 17 supply lines. They will also recycle the refrigerant lines and leave the R-11 refrigerant and change with a R410 refrigerant. They will likewise set up a Honeywell 5000 programmable cooling thermostat. I also have an alternative for an additional $2,818.00 to install a Carrier Performance Series two-stage condenser (31,000 BTUs and a 14 SEER); a Unico two-stage blower module and a Unico R-410 Evaporator Coil module that are both ranked at 14 SEER and are 31,000 BTUs.<p>

Advancements in heating innovation have resulted in systems that contaminate less, boost convenience, and last longer. A twenty to thirty year old furnace generally has an AFUE of about 65%. The most affordable efficiency allowed by law for new gas designs is 78%, and there are numerous options that accomplish 98%, for near total efficiency.<p>
