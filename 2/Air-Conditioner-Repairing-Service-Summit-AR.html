<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical flexible pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily punctured.<p>
