The selection of indoor units has one restriction: their overall power should not surpass the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor units higher than the outside capacity by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect much better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the exact same time, since the total capacity of the entire system is limited by the capacity of the outside unit. Basically, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that some of the spaces might not have a really comfortable temperature level. However, the estimation of the total power is not easy, because it considers not just the small power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
