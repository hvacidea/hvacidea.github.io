<p>The most typical source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock on which homes are constructed. As uranium naturally breaks down, it launches radon gas which is a colorless, odor free, radioactive gas.

When radon ends up being trapped in concentrations and buildings build up indoors, direct exposure to radon ends up being an issue.<p>
<h3>HVAC Maintenance in Cascade Colorado</h3>
<p>There are numerous sources of indoor air pollution in any home. These consist of combustion sources such as oil, gas, kerosene, coal, wood, and tobacco products; building products and furnishings as varied as deteriorated, asbestos-containing insulation, moist or wet carpet, and cabinets or furniture made from certain pushed wood products; products for home cleaning and maintenance, individual care, or hobbies; central heating and cooling systems and humidification gadgets; and outdoor sources such as radon, pesticides, and outdoor air contamination.<p>
<p>The majority of people do not recognize that the HVAC connections and systems can come loose or break in time. That can jeopardize the efficiency of the system and eventually harm it enough that you need to buy furnace replacement or AC replacement.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
