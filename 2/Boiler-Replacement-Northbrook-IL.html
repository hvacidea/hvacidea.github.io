Currently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) standards but it does offer standards about the most common IAQ office grievances.<p>
<p>In more complex plans, warm air is permitted to increase and flow out high structure openings to the outdoors (stack impact ), causing cool outside air to be drawn into low structure openings. Natural ventilation plans can use very little energy, however care must be taken to ensure comfort. In damp or warm environments, preserving thermal convenience entirely via natural ventilation might not be possible. Air conditioning systems are utilized, either as backups or supplements.
