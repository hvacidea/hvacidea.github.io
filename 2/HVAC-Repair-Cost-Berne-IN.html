<p>When they position a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, a lot of Midtown Houston Tx clients do not understand why their HVAC system is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors system we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have an excellent concept of how thick the ice build-up remains in the evaporator coil.
