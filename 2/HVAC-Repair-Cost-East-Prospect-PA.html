More major than most allergenic residential or commercial properties is the capability of mold to activate episodes personallies that already have asthma, a serious breathing disease.<p>
<p>Some health results may appear soon after a single exposure or repeated exposures to a toxin. These consist of irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such instant results are generally short-term and treatable. Often the treatment is simply getting rid of the individual's direct exposure to the source of the contamination, if it can be identified.

<p>Sean was extremely handy. He is a really pleasant individual to work with. No pressure applied to purchase additional stuff. Responded to all the concerns that I had.
