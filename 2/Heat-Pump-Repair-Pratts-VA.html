<p>To state there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the a/c unit back into its original box, using the dense-foam packing material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s below package to raise it up and safeguard it from moisture.<p>

By contrast, replacing a furnace and inspecting filter can generally be done in simply a couple of minutes, frequently with no tools needed. As a safety measure, prior to cleaning your furnace filter, make sure to shut off the furnace either at the thermostat or using the power switch, usually installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
