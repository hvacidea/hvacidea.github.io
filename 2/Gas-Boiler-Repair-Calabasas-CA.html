<p>Fact: Geothermal systems really take in no water. All the water is returned to that very same aquifer if an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that lost the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceedingly uncommon now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems in fact eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have actually been vaporized in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>The heat pump gained popularity in the 1950s in Japan and the United States. 12 Heatpump can extract heat from numerous sources, such as ecological air, exhaust air from a building, or from the ground.

Instead, the electric power taken in by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is actually heated up, simply as by an electric heater that draws the very same quantity of power.<p>
