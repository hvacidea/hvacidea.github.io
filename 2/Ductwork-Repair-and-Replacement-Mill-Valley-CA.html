<h3>Advantages of Pre-Insulated Duct Systems in Mill Valley CA</h3>
<p>The icing problem becomes a lot more serious with lower outside temperatures, so heat pumps are commonly installed in tandem with a more standard form of heating, such as an electrical heater, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heatpump during harsher winter season temperature levels. In this case, the heat pump is used effectively during the milder temperatures, and the system is switched to the conventional heat source when the outside temperature is lower.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, because something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
