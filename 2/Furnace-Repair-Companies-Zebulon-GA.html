<p>The function of most building ventilation systems is to bring in sufficient fresh air for occupant comfort while managing temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and developing security at reasonable energy costs. Load determining is referred to as the Handbook J estimation and need to be performed by the HVAC contractor prior to giving an installation or system cost for air conditioning. Move to another contractor if your contractor states they know the size of air conditioning unit you require based on experience or on square video footage alone. Similar to measuring the size of a system needed based upon BTUs, figuring out the correct size of system for your home also depends upon the system load-- how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
<p>A ducted heat pump looks like a large central air conditioning conditioner system that sits outside your home. Heat pumps work on electricity and work like a/c in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air. This allows them to produce 2 to 3 times as much heat as a standard electric heating unit (like an area heating unit) with the same quantity of electrical power. They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
