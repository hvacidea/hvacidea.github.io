<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend used in automobiles in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12.

For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and carrying out far better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "inexpensive" by many people.<p>

<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage.
