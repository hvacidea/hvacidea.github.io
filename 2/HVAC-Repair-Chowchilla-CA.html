<h3>Why Fall Is the Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System at Chowchilla CA</h3>
<p>We discovered Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very happy that somebody as knowledgeable as Adam was able to return and fix the air conditioner. We had actually bought the club member maintenance plan, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to test the a/c before you buy. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam said he had ways to test AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had understood him then.<p>
