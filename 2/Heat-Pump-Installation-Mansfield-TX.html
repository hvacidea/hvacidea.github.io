<p>When mounting a wall sensing unit, think about the height at which they ought to be placed. Many commonly they are installed at height-level or somewhat lower, if people primarily remain seated in that particular location. However, the molecular weight of some substances makes them gravitate towards the flooring or ceiling; depending on what pollutant you're attempting to track you'll need to put the sensing unit accordingly. For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the highest concentrations inside structures are typically near the ceiling. Alternatively, ozone is much heavier than air and stays near the flooring.<p>
