<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also typically referred to as "reverse cycle a/c". The heatpump is considerably more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, along with the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system also changes functions to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
