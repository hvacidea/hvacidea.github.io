<p>I am very satisfied with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) diagnosed the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour.

<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, often referred to as central air conditioning" or split-system a/c", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and registers (i.e., openings in the walls, floors, or ceilings covered by grills) bring cooled air from the air conditioning system to the home. This cooled air becomes warmer as it flows through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioning conditioner through return ducts and registers. Find out how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
