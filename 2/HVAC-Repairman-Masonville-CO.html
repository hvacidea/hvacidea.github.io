Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside system as near to the house as possible per my request.

Scott was really educated of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
