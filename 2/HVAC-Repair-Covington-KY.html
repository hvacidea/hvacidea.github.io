<h3>The Way to Choose An HVAC Company in Covington KY</h3>

Call an experienced technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>
<p>Since it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize system won't be able to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. Due to the fact that it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a possibility to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary moisture. The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In truth, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>
