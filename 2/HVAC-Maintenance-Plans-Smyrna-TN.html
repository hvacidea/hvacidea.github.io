<p>When installing a wall sensor, consider the height at which they need to be put. Most typically they are installed at height-level or slightly lower, if people primarily stay seated in that specific area. However, the molecular weight of some substances makes them gravitate towards the flooring or ceiling; depending on what pollutant you're trying to track you'll need to position the sensor appropriately. For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the highest concentrations inside buildings are generally near the ceiling. Conversely, ozone is much heavier than air and remains near the floor.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should momentarily change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
