<p>Old lead-based paint is the most significant source of lead direct exposure in the U.S. today. Harmful direct exposures to lead can be created when lead-based paint is incorrectly removed from surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations of airborne lead particles in homes can likewise result from lead dust from outside sources, including polluted soil tracked within, and use of lead in specific indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.<p>
<p>In more complex plans, warm air is allowed to increase and stream out high structure openings to the outdoors (stack result ), causing cool outside air to be drawn into low building openings. Natural ventilation schemes can use very little energy, however care should be required to make sure comfort. In warm or humid climates, keeping thermal comfort entirely by means of natural ventilation may not be possible. Air conditioning systems are used, either as supplements or backups. Air-side economizers also use outside air to condition areas, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and distribute cool outside air when proper.<p>
