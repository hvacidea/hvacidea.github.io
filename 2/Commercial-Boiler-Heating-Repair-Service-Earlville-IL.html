<p>Great service within 24 hr and a fair rate. The technician (Camryn) was very extensive and on-time in explaining what services would be carried out. Similarly Camryn supplied fantastic customer care at the end of the appointment by describing precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of suggestions of some maintenance tasks we may wish to have actually performed in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale techniques used by some in the market.<p>
<p>Next, and possibly simply as essential when it concerns central air expenses, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too big will have an easy time keeping the house cool, but will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not have the ability to properly cool the home on hot days. Thinking about larger systems cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air system needs to hold.<p>
