<p>The majority of central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the very same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your home flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the air conditioning unit works but your house does not cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>
