<p>Spot Ventilation. Exterior exhaust fans need to be installed in all bathrooms and kitchen areas. These fans eliminate humidity and carbon monoxide gas. The most effective fans are peaceful and long lasting. Use fans that run at one sone or less and exhaust to the outdoors. Fans equipped with timers or de-humidistat controls work to guarantee the fans run for an adequate period of time. A good general rule is to run a bathroom fan for about 45 minutes after a shower.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have found them to be fairly priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my primary furnace they worked out beyond what was required and renovated the entire plenum and the duct for the water heater due to the fact that the service technicians thought they simply didn't appear right and they could not leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
