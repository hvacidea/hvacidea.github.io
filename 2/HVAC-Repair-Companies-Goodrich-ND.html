<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
