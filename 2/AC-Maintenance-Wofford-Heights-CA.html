<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>How environment change impacts air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for modern-day a/c) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioner increase. This increase has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit should increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioner's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

<p>Outdoor impurities. Outdoor particulates can be drawn inside when the heating or cooling system draws air into a home. Particulates and irritants found in outdoor air can be asthma triggers. Filtering incoming air for HVAC systems effectively filters particulates.
