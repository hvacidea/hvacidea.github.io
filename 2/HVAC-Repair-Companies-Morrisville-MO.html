<p>Because it's the most common heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your home via ducts, and cool air is gathered through cold air return vents. Gas heaters are ranked for performance. Older units from the 1970s might be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is squandered during the combustion process. Today's models vary from a minimum of 78% up to 98.5%. If your house currently has ducts, changing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a reasonably uncomplicated process. Installing a new gas furnace system can be rather pricey if you are adding on to your home or retrofitting a home without ducting.<p>
