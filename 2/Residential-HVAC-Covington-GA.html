<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to tear and use and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>They were excellent! Numerous HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally asked for.
