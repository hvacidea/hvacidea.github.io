<p>How climate change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for contemporary ac system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the ac system boost. This boost has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system must increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The a/c's power usage will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>

A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation.
