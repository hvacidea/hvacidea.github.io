<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to briefly change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
