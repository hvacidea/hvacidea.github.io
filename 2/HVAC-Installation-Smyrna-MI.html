<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Smyrna MI Home Owners</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was quick and really clear about his assessment, guaranteeing I understood what was kept an eye out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was great overall.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is typically a lack of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
