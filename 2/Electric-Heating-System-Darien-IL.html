<h3>AC Compressor in Darien Illinois</h3>
<p>You're probably hearing the fan motor attempting to start without the boost it needs from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can usually conclude that the capacitor has actually stopped working. Often you can get the compressor fan spinning (clockwise) by pushing it with a thin stick or long screwdriver poked through the grille. But the opportunities are good that this may work for one cycle, but the capacitor will fail next time the AC goes on. It's best to change the capacitor.<p>
