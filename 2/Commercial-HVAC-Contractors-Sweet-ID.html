And, if you have actually signed up for an energy-saving gadget from your local power energy, the unit can take even longer to reset. If you've set up the parts shown and reinstalled the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and lowered the temperature level below the indoor temperature level, and the system doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
