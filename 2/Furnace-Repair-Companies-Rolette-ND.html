<p>Next, and maybe just as crucial when it comes to central air conditioning expenses, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time getting rid of humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too small will not be able to effectively cool the home on hot days. Thinking about bigger systems cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
<p>After the system has been checked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with standard foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers ought to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and utilize the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside ought to be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
