<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical material in time.

Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
