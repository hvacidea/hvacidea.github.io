<p>Buildings are designed or meant to react actively to a few of these changes around them with heating, cooling, aerating, air cleaning or illuminating systems. We clean up, sanitize, and keep surface areas to boost their efficiency, appearance, or longevity. In other cases, such modifications subtly or even dramatically modify buildings in ways that may be essential to their own integrity or their influence on building occupants through the development of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that specify them at any time.
