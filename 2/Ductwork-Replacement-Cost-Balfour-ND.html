<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel regularly gets ask for consultation and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation procedure. Nevertheless, many of these homes were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
