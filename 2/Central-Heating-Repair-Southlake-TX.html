<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to run. A large-scale compressor also costs more to run because it just takes more electricity to run a larger system. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so quickly that it turns off prior to it has a possibility to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the needed wetness. The result is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature shows. In fact, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>
