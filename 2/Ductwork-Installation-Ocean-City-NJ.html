<p>Great Item! Shipment was kind of odd being that package was opened and products could have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The product was very lite weight and requires time to use. Note: purchase advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to watch the video initially prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After calling assistance, we fixed concerns. I would recommend this item to anyone who's redesigning or installing their restroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
