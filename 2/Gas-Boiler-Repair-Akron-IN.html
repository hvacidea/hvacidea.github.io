<p>Consumer products that contain methylene chloride include paint strippers, adhesive removers, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is known to cause cancer in animals.

<p>Volatile natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside your home and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals released as gases from products or procedures; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Typical sources of VOCs indoors include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as relatively innocuous as a new carpet is likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors could consist of unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within throughout water usage.<p>
<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material with time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
