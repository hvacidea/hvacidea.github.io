<p>A packaged system, normally installed on the roofing, is most typically used on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for house owners to think about. Often times, these systems contain not just the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this unit is certainly the cost. Packaged units are terrific for those wanting to conserve cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, because the system is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are generally just available for larger homes due to their high power and capacity.
