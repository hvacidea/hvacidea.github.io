<h3>Stop Your Air Conditioner Leaking Water in Hardy AR</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very delighted that somebody as experienced as Adam was able to return and repair the air conditioner. We had bought the club member maintenance strategy, which helped offset the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any property buyers: work with Blue Flame to check the air conditioner before you buy. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to test AC units even in winter season. We want we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't offer them.  Second of all like prolonged auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be entirely benefited from. Most companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found somebody to correctly service and the unit has been running problem totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
