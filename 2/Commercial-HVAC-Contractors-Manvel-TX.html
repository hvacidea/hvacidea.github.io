<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you wouldn't use them.. Second of all like extended vehicle guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is actually unfortunate.
