<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives requests for assessment and assistance in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation measure. Nevertheless, a number of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was installed many years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

This minimizes the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted individually. PTAC systems may be adjusted to offer heating in winter, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the ac system into a heat pump While room air conditioning provides optimum versatility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is typically more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>
