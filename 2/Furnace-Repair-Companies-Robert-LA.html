<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives ask for consultation and assistance in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms.

However, a number of these homes were discovered to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
