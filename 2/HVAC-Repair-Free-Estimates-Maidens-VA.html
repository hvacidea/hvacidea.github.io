<p>A packaged unit, generally set up on the roofing, is most frequently used on commercial buildings, but it is also an alternative for homeowners to consider. Often times, these units consist of not only the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this system is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those seeking to save cash on the installation of a new heating & cooling system separately, given that the system is combined. However, one con is that these units are typically just readily available for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be an excellent way to save cash on a total HVAC system, they're still considerably more pricey than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best option for homeowners looking for short-term savings or those with smaller sized budget plans.<p>
