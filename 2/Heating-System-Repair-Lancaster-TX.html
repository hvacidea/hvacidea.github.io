<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs silently and efficiently, however to have 2 significant parts stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice prior to work started. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Whatever heating unit you install, it's essential that it's sized properly for your house. Too big and you'll be paying more for equipment and installation than you should. Plus, it will utilize excessive energy for the quantity of heat you desire produced. If the system is too small, then your home will not be heated adequately and the system will have to constantly go to try to heat the whole home, which will increase heating costs.<p>
<p>We know that repairing your heater exceeds repairing something that's broken in your home. When your heat isn't working, you'll be physically uncomfortable and you may be stressed, tired, anxious, or distressed about the issue, too. We intend to help with all of those things.

<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating unit require fairly little attention. However, similar to any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is essential to keep the system working efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating unit are similar to those of conventional hot water heater. The collectors, piping and tank should be checked for leaks, the system should be flushed occasionally to get rid of tank and collected pollutants (scaling in difficult water locations). The systems should be examined at least two times each year for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be rinsed occasionally to remove dust gathered in order to improve collector performance.<p>
<p>Installation includes digging deep holes or long trenches to set up the pipelines, so it's labor-intensive on the front end. Nevertheless, you'll save cash over the long term because of the lower energy costs. Also, a geothermal system tends to last about two times as long as traditional air-source systems. The lack of moving parts implies you're less most likely to spend huge on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be anticipated to last for 50 years. They're significantly more effective then even the highest-efficiency air source units.<p>
