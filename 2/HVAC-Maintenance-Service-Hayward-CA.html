<p>G&S did an excellent job installing our brand-new furnace and AC unit. The best thing about G&S is that they guarantee for 1 year. The circuit board in our furnace stopped working within a couple of months (no fault of G&S). Producers warranty would cover the parts cost but G&S fixed and covered labor cost under their warranty. Likewise they diagnosed the problem and fixed extremely rapidly. Definitely A++ installation and service.<p>
<p>I am extremely impressed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call organisation several years earlier and understand the value of having the best parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my house at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on one of the coldest nights of the year. I will definitely be utilizing Waycoff's again, and would recommend them to everyone. Thank You quite.<p>
