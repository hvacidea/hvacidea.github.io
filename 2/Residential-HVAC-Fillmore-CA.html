<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Over the previous few years, there has actually been some publicity suggesting that houseplants have been shown to reduce levels of some chemicals in laboratory experiments. There is presently no proof, nevertheless, that an affordable variety of houseplants get rid of substantial quantities of toxins in workplaces and houses.
