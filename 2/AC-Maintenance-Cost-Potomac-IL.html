<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE USING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will flow from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard hot water heater. This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut off completely.<p>
