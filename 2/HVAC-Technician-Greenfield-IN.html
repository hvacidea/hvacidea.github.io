<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode".

When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (generally chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy.
