<p>Radiant heat covers a series of different heater, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats by dispersing warm water through a series of pipelines set up in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the floor and into the room.<p>

<p>While radon in water is not an issue in homes served by a lot of public water supplies, it has been discovered in well water. If you have actually tested the air in your house and discovered a radon issue, and you have a well, call a lab accredited to determine radiation in water to have your water checked. Radon problems in water can be easily fixed. Call your state radon workplace or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) to find out more.<p>
<p>Furthermore, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why rooms heated up by radiators are susceptible to cold spots", suggesting that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot next to the radiators. This usually results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your home escape out of the window. Convected heat provides heat from the flooring up throughout the space with no cold spots or stuffiness in the area being heated up.<p>
