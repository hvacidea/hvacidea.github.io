<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect next to the compressor and the main panel.

You should hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
