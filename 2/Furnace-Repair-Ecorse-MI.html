Even when it was news my client most likely wouldn't want to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I value the honesty. Integrity isn't just their name, it's an organisation model they take seriously. You people are officially on speed dial. Speak to you soon.<p>

The most convenient way to thaw your HVAC devices is to leave the system off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
