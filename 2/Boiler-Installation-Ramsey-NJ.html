<p>The thermostat is the "heart" of your radiant heat system, managing the power to the heating wires and also controling the temperature of the flooring. All circuitry for your radiant heating system either goes to it or from it. Most people will install their thermostat near the entryway of the space they are heating, near the light switches. However, anywhere you install it is great as long as the location is dry and unblocked.<p>

<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can take place gradually because of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should do the trick up until you buy a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>
<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They provide me top priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never ever try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
