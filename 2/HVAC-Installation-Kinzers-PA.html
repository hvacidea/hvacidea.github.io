<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the price excellent but Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
