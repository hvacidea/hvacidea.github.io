<p>We look at ideas prior to we supply recommendations to change rather than repair a heating system. Among the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to use, or if energy bills are higher year after year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It may be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient model, then you would be squandering money by not replacing the older unit.<p>
<p>It may be time to clean the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils will not offer off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay might have bonded together-- something that can happen over time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, take apart the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to do the trick up until you purchase a replacement-- which you ought to do soon.<p>
