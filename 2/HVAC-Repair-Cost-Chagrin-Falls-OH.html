<p>We look at ideas before we offer advice to replace rather than repair a heating unit. Among the hints we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy bills are higher every year, we know the system is not running efficiently. It might be in best condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient model, then you would be squandering money by not changing the older system.<p>
<p>I am very amazed with this company. Among my systems blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) identified the issue within 5 minutes of being on site. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years earlier and understand the importance of having the right parts on the truck to get any job back up and running. I'm likewise satisfied that he appeared at my house at 8:00 PM for no extra charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's once again, and would recommend them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
