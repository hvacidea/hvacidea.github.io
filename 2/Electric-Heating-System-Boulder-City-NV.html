<h3>What is HVAC? HVAC Information For Boulder City NV Home Owners</h3>

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
