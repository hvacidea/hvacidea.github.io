<p>When setting up over concrete slabs, we suggest using our insulation boards. Warmup Insulation Boards will save you cash when used in combination with underfloor heating by serving as a very effective thermal barrier. They reflects the heat upwards into the floor tile instead of enabling heat to warm up the concrete slab below. By using Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it might take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>

Permeable materials, wall, floor, and ceiling coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to 48 hours might become a source for mold growth and must be discarded. In some cases there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can flourish in concealed or rarely accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products including carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Repair the moisture issue, either by finding the leak or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly clean the area utilizing established health department recommendations.<p>
