<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air conditioning units is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mix of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, soot, and pollen. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, produced by building, for example, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures via natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>A packaged system, usually set up on the roofing system, is most typically utilized on commercial buildings, however it is also a choice for property owners to think about. Oftentimes, these units contain not just the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this system is surely the cost. Packaged units are fantastic for those looking to conserve money on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system individually, because the unit is combined. Nevertheless, one con is that these systems are typically only readily available for larger houses due to their high power and capacity.

Therefore, this might not be the very best alternative for house owners searching for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
