<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to wear and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>Indoor pollutants. These consist of chemicals utilized in the building or remodelling of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds).

Gas cook tops ought to be utilized with fans that send exhaust exterior. Gas-fired heating devices need to be sealed and power-vented systems installed to remove items of insufficient combustion. Wood-burning stoves can likewise develop particulates and must be vented outside.<p>
