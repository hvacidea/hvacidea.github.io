<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was fast and very clear about his evaluation, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>

<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was really helpful in collecting details on the phone and providing clear directions about how to momentarily manage the issue and prepare the heatpump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was remarkably efficient and used clear interaction about the issue, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was friendly and expert. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi began.
