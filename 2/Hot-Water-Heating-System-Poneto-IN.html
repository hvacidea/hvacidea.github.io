<p>Sean was extremely valuable. He is a really pleasant individual to deal with. No pressure used to buy additional things. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to make sure they were no issues besides the blower motor. The only factor he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am really pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the ac system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
