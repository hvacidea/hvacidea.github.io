Not just was the cost terrific but Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the total air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>It might be time to clean up the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't offer off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC doesn't turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur gradually because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before examining the run relay, turn off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts.
