Your heating and cooling contractor needs to evaluate and, if necessary, update the building envelope. For instance, he may seal spaces and cracks in the external walls and attic floor, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your heating and cooling expenses. Insulation may be a more effective option to your cooling issues than changing your devices.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a series of different heating systems, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems operate on comparable principles.

When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electrical energy) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the room.<p>
