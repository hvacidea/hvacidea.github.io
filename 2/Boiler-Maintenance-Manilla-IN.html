PTACs, which are frequently used in hotels, have two separate systems (terminal packages), the evaporative system on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening travelling through the wall and connecting them. This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each room to be changed separately. PTAC systems might be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioner into a heatpump While space cooling offers maximum versatility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is usually more costly than central air.<p>

Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid website with an agenda. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be dealing with a credible company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a similar score are the very same).
