This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each room to be changed separately. PTAC systems might be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioner into a heatpump While space cooling offers maximum versatility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is usually more costly than central air.<p>
