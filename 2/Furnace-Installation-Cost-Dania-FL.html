<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job finding the outdoor unit as near your house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was extremely well-informed of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.)
