<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost terrific but Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the general air circulation more optimized. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
