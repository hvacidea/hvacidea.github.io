<h3>Facts All Decatur AL Homeowners Must Know About Ductwork</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The current pattern in house construction is to minimize air leakage through fractures and other openings in walls, floorings, and roofing systems. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor makeup air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for makeup air for kitchens and bathrooms in houses are much higher. This fresh makeup air assists and dilutes indoor pollutants exhaust them from the house.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend utilized in autos in the U.S. up until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this type of application, however is still imported and can be purchased and utilized by licensed HVAC specialists. For systems requiring just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by many individuals.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, low-cost flexible hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
