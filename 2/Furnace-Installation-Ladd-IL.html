<p>The quality of the air inside our offices, houses and schools matters, particularly given that we invest most of our lives inside.

<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is easy. Heat increases, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the flooring level.

All items in the hot zone reach stability in temperature after the radiant heat system has actually been operating for a while, including individuals. When the furnace kicks in and that unexpected shot of coolness when it shuts off, gone is that rush of hot air.<p>
