<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever purchase prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great financial investment in my opinion. Never ever try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
