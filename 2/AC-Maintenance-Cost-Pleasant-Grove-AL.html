<p>Central air conditioning systems are determined in loads. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it suggests the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>EER stands for Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The energy performance of central air systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set variety of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a traditional system of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. Air cleaning happens when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness. The objective is to supply adequate modifications to make sure a healthy environment. There are several types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A typical aspect required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Air Conditioning Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
