The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the issue, the solution and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
