Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
