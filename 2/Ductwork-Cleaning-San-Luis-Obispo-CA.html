Also, methylene chloride is converted to carbon monoxide in the body and can cause signs connected with exposure to carbon monoxide.

<p>EER represents Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning units is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why many people don't utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Unstable natural compounds (VOCs)-- These are the main contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals discharged as gases from procedures or items; for the most part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs inside your home include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly harmless as a new carpet is most likely to be producing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might consist of unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within throughout water usage.<p>
<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and people; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can become airborne. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these impurities through the house.<p>
