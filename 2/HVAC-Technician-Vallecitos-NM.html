<p>Packaged terminal a/c unit (PTAC) systems are also called wall-split air conditioning systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are often utilized in hotels, have 2 different systems (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the outside, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each room to be changed individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to offer heating in cold weather, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heater, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioner into a heatpump While room air conditioning offers optimum versatility, when utilized to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more expensive than central air.<p>
