In tasks where union subscription is not a concern, an HVAC technician may complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system.

Due to the fact that they don't need any brand-new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions.
