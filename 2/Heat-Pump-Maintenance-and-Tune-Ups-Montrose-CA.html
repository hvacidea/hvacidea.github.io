<p>Radiant heating covers a series of various heating systems, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing hot water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the warm water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the floor and into the space.<p>
