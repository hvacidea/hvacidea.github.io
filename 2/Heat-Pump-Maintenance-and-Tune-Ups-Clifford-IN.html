<h3>Facts All Homeowners Must Know About HVAC Installation in Clifford IN</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his assessment, ensuring I understood what was kept an eye out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I had the ability to go buy a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on cost for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and educated. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
