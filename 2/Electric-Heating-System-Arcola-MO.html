This warmed air is then dispersed about the home by a fan through ductwork" and circulated back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns."

Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, however some are electrically powered as well.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are typically referred to as just glowing systems.

When the system is in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your house.
