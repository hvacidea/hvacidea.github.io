<h3>Things Every Homeowner Truth About Selecting Hasbrouck Heights NJ HVAC Firms </h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by enhancing air flow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. Sometimes, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced instantly after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>

This means that, in addition to changing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to routinely clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually lead to harm to the compressor, because the condenser coil is responsible for discharging both the indoor heat (as gotten by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
