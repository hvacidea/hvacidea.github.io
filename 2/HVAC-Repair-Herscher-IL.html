<h3>What to Look for in an AC Heating Repair Service at Herscher IL</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a federal government firm, performed a research study in the 1990s to investigate 2 claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. In many cases, determined particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
