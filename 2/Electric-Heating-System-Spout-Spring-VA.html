<p>Lead has long been recognized as a damaging toxic waste. In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human being Services called lead the " number one ecological danger to the health of children in the United States." There are many methods which people are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, polluted soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead gets in the body when a private breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before it was understood how harmful lead could be, it was used in paint, gas, water pipes, and many other items.<p>
<p>You ought to always employ a professional to carry out AC repair, for the exact same reason that you rely on an expert plumbing or electrician.

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
