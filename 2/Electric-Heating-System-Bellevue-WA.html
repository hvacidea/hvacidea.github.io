<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless harmful gas. Because it is impossible to see, smell or taste, CO can eliminate you before you understand it remains in your home. At lower levels of direct exposure, CO causes moderate impacts that are typically incorrect for the influenza. These signs consist of headaches, lightheadedness, tiredness, queasiness and disorientation.
