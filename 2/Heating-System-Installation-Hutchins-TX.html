<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory studies, it has actually been shown to cause cancer in animals. Current studies suggest that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, nevertheless, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do decline them until they have been properly dried.
