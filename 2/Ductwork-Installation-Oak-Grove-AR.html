<p>Many commercial buildings utilize mechanical ventilation-- fans and ductwork-- that become part of the heating and HVAC systems. Some structures can also use natural ventilation by opening doors or windows. The ventilation rate" is the quantity of outside air introduced into an area per an unit of time, and is typically revealed in cubic feet per minute (cfm). You can find the ASHRAE (American Society of Air-Conditioning, heating and refrigerating Engineers) minimum ventilation rates for appropriate air quality online.<p>
<p>Indoor contaminants. These consist of chemicals used in the construction or remodelling of buildings (e.g., glues, off-gassing from carpets, emissions from particle board, cleaning compounds).

To compensate for this, the heat pump system must temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
