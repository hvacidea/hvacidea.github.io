<p>Keep an eye out for indications of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable materials, ceiling, floor, and wall coverings, and furniture discovered in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to two days may become a source for mold development and should be discarded. Often there is a moldy odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can thrive in concealed or rarely accessed locations of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic.

Fix the moisture problem, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly clean the location using recognized health department recommendations.<p>
