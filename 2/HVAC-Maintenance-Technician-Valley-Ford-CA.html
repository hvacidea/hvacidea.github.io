<p>In addition, worker health symptoms such as colds, headaches, drowsiness, inflammation, and irregular breathing may be caused as the result of temperature level extremes, improper humidity levels, and too much or too little air circulation.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to temporarily switch back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
