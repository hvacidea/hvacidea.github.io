<p>A/c can also be supplied by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
<p>The primary factor house owners do not purchase an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 per year, depending on the amount of services used.

Nevertheless, some producers need routine maintenance as a term of the guarantee.<p>
