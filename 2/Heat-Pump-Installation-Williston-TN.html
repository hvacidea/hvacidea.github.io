<p>Because it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to run. An oversize compressor also costs more to run since it simply takes more electrical power to run a larger unit. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a possibility to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to draw out the needed moisture. The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level suggests. In fact, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
