<p>Making use of air filters can trap a few of the air toxins. The Department of Energy's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy section recommends that "Air Filtration ought to have a Minimum Performance Reporting Value (MERV) of 13 as determined by ASHRAE 52.2-1999." citation needed Air filters are used to decrease the amount of dust that reaches the wet coils.

<p>When installing the entire system, geothermal heat pump cost is far more than other heat pump types. Geothermal systems need underground ground loops to harness the Earth's natural energy. Setting up one involved excavation, running hundreds of lawns of piping, burying the loop, and more. This procedure is rather expensive. Installing a brand-new geothermal heat pump to work with an existing ground loop is far cheaper.<p>
<p>When your HVAC expert tells you to alter your filters routinely, they're not joking. It's as essential as a routine oil change in your automobile. An unclean filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps impurities and particles in the air. Energy Star advises changing your filter when every 3 months. During high usage months, inspect the filters at least regular monthly.<p>
