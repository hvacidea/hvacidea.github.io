<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the job based only on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the few reasonable ones got. Others were almost two times the amount Protex quoted for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider. ProTex properly encouraged me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Honesty) The set up group was considerate of my house and installed the equipment in the expected amount of time. post set up inspection outcomes look great for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 year old 4 heap R22 unit it changed (likewise Carrier).<p>
