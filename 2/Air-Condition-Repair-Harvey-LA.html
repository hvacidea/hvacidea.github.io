Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put surge protectors on the unit and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no issues other than the blower motor. The only factor he might not install the brand-new blower motor was since there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the concern is.<p>
