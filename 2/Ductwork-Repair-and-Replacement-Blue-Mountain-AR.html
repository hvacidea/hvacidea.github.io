<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you ought to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
