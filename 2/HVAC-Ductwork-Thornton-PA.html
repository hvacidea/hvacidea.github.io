What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert going over my choices. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss choices. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my buddies.<p>
