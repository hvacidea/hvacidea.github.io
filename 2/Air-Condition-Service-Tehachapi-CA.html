<h3>How To Prevent Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Tehachapi CA</h3>

Similar to other types of heatpump, ground source heatpump have their geothermal performance rated according to their coefficient of performance (POLICE). COP rates how much heat a system produces or eliminates (depending upon whether it is, Heating or cooling), versus just how much the system uses to develop the heating or cooling impact. Most ground source heatpump have Police officers of about 3.0 to 5.0. What this means is that for every system of energy utilized by a geothermal heat pump, around 3 to 5 systems are supplied back in the type of heat.<p>
