<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
