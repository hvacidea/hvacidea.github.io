Heaters that kick on often may be because of an unclean filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air correctly. If your furnace is making a great deal of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal problem. While humming is caused by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>
