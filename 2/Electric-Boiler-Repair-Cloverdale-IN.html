<p>There are 2 main forms of radiant flooring heating, or RFH as it's understood in the house heating service. One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the floor surface. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the flooring are required to resist existing, which then creates heat.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance products that just a skilled HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can result in expensive compressor failure, however a homeowner doesn't have the skills or tools essential to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and proper air flow are essential to a well-functioning system, but house owners lack the required devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still necessary to have an expert technician inspect the system periodically.<p>
