<p>In more complex plans, warm air is permitted to rise and stream out high building openings to the outside (stack impact ), causing cool outside air to be drawn into low structure openings. Natural ventilation schemes can use extremely little energy, but care must be required to ensure comfort. In warm or damp climates, maintaining thermal comfort solely via natural ventilation may not be possible. A/c systems are used, either as supplements or backups. Air-side economizers likewise utilize outside air to condition areas, but do so using fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to introduce and distribute cool outside air when suitable.<p>
