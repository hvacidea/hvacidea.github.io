He dedicated to the task based just on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs offer was one of the couple of affordable ones got. Others were nearly twice the amount Protex priced quote for low end off brand name equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex appropriately recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The set up team was considerate of my house and installed the equipment in the expected amount of time. post set up evaluation outcomes look great for braising and pipes quality. New system cools much better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 system it replaced (likewise Provider).<p>
