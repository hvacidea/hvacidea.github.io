<p>Though it may be difficult to believe, the air inside your home can be even worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are infamous for decreasing the air quality in your house, however there are numerous other pollutants that can not only filthy up the air, however lead to other health issues.

<p>The split system is the most typical. Many people are used to seeing this type in the backyards of homes.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you ought to watch out for. Initially, you must examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
