<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you need to inspect your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
