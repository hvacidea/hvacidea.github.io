<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC fridges illegal. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the method as "that German technology". 29 31 However, in 2004, Greenpeace dealt with multinational corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to produce a corporate coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, 4 years later, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric started to take steps to support production and use in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA chose in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-404a, r-410a and r-134a are, since 2020, being changed with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and air conditioning, R-1234yf in cars, R-32 in residential cooling and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration. R-600 (isobutane) is already widely used in residential refrigeration.<p>
<h3>Commercial Air Conditioner in Gretna Louisiana</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & educated throughout the visit. They advised replacing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap but a fast internet search verified WSE wasn't pumping up rates, so I happily had them replaced. However, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the go to or the new part. I was extremely happy they waited their work and fixed the issue. Will absolutely be utilizing them once again.<p>
<p>When our furnace was dying, we contacted two local companies for bids. While both were helpful and helpful, Ballard Gas gave us a much better offer, for exceptional service. Rather than a basic sales job, the owner of the company made a complete assessment of our heating unit and situated methods we could have more even heat. He consisted of these significant but small adjustments in his quote. Since of current warmer summer seasons and for environmental factors, we decided to change from a gas furnace to an electric heat pump.<p>
<p>I have actually been working in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am starting my own HVAC company. I can tell you that it is a tough task that the employees sweat and bleed at, especially residential service. When there is no work there is no pay. That is where PMs work, keeps us in touch with consumers and keeps men working. When a sales man concerns your house he is there to sell, that is the only method he is paid. You have an excellent Tech PM your system, he is paying expenses and need to not "require" to sell you something you do not require. Your $1500 UV light is something you were sold on. For me, I provide you the options for your needs and you choose if you require it.<p>
