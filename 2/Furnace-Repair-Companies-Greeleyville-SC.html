<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we want to help keep your house's Indoor Air Quality at its finest. The capability to cool and heat your house at optimal efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your home is presently and the size of your house.

<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that utilizes low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan.

Loosen the old AC contactor prior to removing the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Image 6).<p>
