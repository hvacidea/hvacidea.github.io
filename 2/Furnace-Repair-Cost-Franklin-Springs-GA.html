<p>. Prior to selecting the installation area of air conditioning unit, numerous primary factors require to be considered. First off, the instructions of air flow from the indoor units need to not fall on the location of rest or work area. Secondly, there need to not be any barriers on the way of the airflow that may avoid it from covering the area of the properties as much as possible.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture, Air cleaning occurs. The objective is to provide adequate modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this. A common component required in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
