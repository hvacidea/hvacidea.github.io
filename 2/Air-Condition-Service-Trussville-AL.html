<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor units has one constraint: their total power ought to not surpass the capacity of the outside system. In practice, nevertheless, it is really common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capability by a minimum of 20%. However, it is incorrect to expect much better performance when all indoor systems are switched on at the same time, since the total capacity of the entire system is restricted by the capacity of the outside unit. Simply put, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a method that some of the rooms might not have a really comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the overall power is not simple, given that it takes into consideration not just the nominal power of the units, but likewise the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
