<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set series of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not use this measurement much any longer.<p>
<p>Aside from space heating, the geothermal heater can also be linked to a gadget referred to as a geothermal desuperheater. The geothermal desuperheater can recycle the excess heat created from the ground source heatpump compressor and uses it to heat water. This suggests that this device can also supply free hot water for domestic usage in addition to its standard geothermal heating and cooling purpose.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a requirement for air conditioner repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you ought to examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
