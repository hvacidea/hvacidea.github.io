<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you would not use them.. Secondly like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found someone to effectively service and the unit has actually been running issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
