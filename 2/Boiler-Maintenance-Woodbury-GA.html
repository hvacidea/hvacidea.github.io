<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are in some cases integrated with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summer season cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the flow coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in because the storage acts as a heat sink when the system remains in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, causing the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
