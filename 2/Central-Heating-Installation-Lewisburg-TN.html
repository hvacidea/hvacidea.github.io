<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Work in Lewisburg TN?</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping in between a outdoor and indoor unit rather of ducting air directly from the outdoor unit. Indoor units with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>Both must be kept tidy because an air conditioner moves heat between the indoor coil and the outside coil. This implies that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also necessary to regularly clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will ultimately result in harm to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is accountable for discharging both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat generated by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more extreme cold.

To make up for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily change back into the routine a/c mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw.
