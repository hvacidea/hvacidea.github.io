<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you need to check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
