<h3>Emergency Furnace Repair in Oakley Utah</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The unit runs silently and effectively, however to have two significant parts fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing before work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>The payback for a system can vary from 2-10 years, while the life time of a system can be 18-23 years, almost double a standard system.
