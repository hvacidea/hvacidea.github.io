<p>. Before picking the installation place of a/c, numerous primary elements need to be considered. First of all, the direction of air flow from the indoor systems must not fall on the location of rest or workspace. Secondly, there need to not be any challenges on the way of the airflow that may prevent it from covering the space of the premises as much as possible. The outdoor unit should also be found in an open area, otherwise the heat from the house will not be efficiently released outdoors and the efficiency of the whole system will drop sharply.
