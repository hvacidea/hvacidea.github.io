<p>All modern-day air conditioning systems, even little window package systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are usually of a lightweight gauze-like product, and should be changed or cleaned as conditions call for. For example, a structure in a high dust environment, or a home with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Furthermore, extremely unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating during a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
