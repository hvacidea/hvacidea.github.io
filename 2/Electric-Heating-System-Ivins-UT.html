<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise apartment or condos bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has viewed the single-family home installation service completely flip on its head the last few years. Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their typically two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to up to 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not just with newbies more familiar with AC living. Longtime Seattle homeowners are finally giving in, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit houses with air-cooling systems.<p>
