<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material in time. In truth, the real nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
