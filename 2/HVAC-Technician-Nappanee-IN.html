<p>My "C" rating is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump.

An F" for $616 in labor costs (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were noted on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by service warranty.

<p>Recent Review: I am extremely delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning unit and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and respectful. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pressing and finishing procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to decrease your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do not accept them until they have been properly dried. Try a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent gos to.<p>

<p>Consider potential effects of indoor air pollution if you use an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit. Follow the manufacturer's directions, especially instructions on the proper fuel and keeping the heating unit appropriately adjusted. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is usually an indication of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While a space heating unit is in use, open a door from the space where the heating unit is located to the rest of the home and open a window somewhat.<p>
