<p>We look at ideas before we provide recommendations to replace rather than repair a heating system. One of the ideas we look at is the cost of energy. If energy expenses are high compared to usage, or if energy expenses are greater year after year, we understand the system is not running efficiently. It may be in perfect condition, but if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to replace it with a more efficient design, then you would be wasting money by not replacing the older system.<p>
<p>Finally, if you do recognize an especially energy-efficient in-floor heating system and pick to install it in your house, you could be eligible for state or federal programs that can help cover your up-front contractor costs. (And these costs can be significant. According to figures collected by Angie's List, house owners can anticipate to pay in between $6 and $16 per square foot, not including tax and labor, for a radiant heat system.) Speak With the U.S. Department of Energy's Database of State Rewards for Renewable Resource (DSIRE) to see if there are refunds, loans or tax reductions readily available for the installation of a more effective in-floor heating system where you live.<p>
