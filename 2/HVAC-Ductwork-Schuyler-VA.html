<p>Current Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
