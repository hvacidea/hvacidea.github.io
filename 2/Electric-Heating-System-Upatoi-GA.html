<p>My eldest kid always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I understood that it actually didnâ $ t disperse air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think about anything else except replacing it. The one I got is worth every penny. The noise level is low and itâ $ s excellent on energy conserving too.<p>
