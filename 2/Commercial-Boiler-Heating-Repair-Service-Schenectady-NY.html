<h3>Three Crucial Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in Schenectady NY</h3>
<p>The remainder of the HVAC system likewise requires to be in leading condition for the a/c unit to work well. This includes the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and signs up, all of which live inside the home. The technician can analyze the ductwork for signs of holes, spaces or excessive dirt if the private parts are in appropriate order. Sealing leakages in ductwork can enhance HVAC effectiveness by as much as 30 percent, and provide for a cooler house in the hot summer season.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (normally chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
