<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent job locating the outside unit as near to your house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work.

<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you ought to look out for. First, you need to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
