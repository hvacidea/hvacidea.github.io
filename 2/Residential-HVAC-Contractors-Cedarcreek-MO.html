<p>Due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize unit won't be able to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. Since it just takes more electrical energy to run a bigger system, an oversize compressor also costs more to operate. And an oversize unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's since it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to circulate the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the needed moisture. The outcome is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature shows. In reality, the space can feel wet and clammy.<p>

As mentioned above, a BTU is a standard system of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>
