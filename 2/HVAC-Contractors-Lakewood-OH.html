<p>Excellent Item! Delivery was type of odd being that package was opened and products might have fell out. However after review of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The product was extremely lite weight and requires time to apply. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to see the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had concerns with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we solved problems. I would advise this product to anybody who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>

<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems use capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power offered to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. In time, capacitors can wear out, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you wish to get those capacitors changed to avoid further damage to your system.<p>
