All of the most recent heating systems are a lot more energy-efficient than those set up even 20 years earlier.

The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is distributed back into your house.

From the pan, the water flows into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement floor drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
