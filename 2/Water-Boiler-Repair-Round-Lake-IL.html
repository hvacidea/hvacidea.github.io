<p>There are 116 highly-rated local duct cleaners. Indoor contamination sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality problems in homes. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor contaminant levels by not bringing in enough outside air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the home. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>

The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was really experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
