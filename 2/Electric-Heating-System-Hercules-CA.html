<p>Typically the most efficient way to enhance indoor air quality is to eliminate private sources of contamination or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or confined; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to reduce the quantity of emissions. In many cases, source control is likewise a more cost-efficient technique to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your house are noted later in this section.<p>
<p>Think about potential effects of indoor air contamination if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heater. Follow the manufacturer's instructions, especially guidelines on the proper fuel and keeping the heating unit correctly adjusted. A persistent yellow-tipped flame is usually an indication of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While a space heating unit is in usage, open a door from the space where the heater is located to the remainder of the house and open a window a little.<p>
