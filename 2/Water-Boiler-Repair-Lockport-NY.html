In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the incoming air is decreased, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (practical heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads.
